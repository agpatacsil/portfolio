          <p class="subheader" style="margin-top: 30px;">OVERVIEW</p>
          <p>Happy House is a mobile app designed to mitigate roommate conflicts
             with an improved system of communication. We worked in teams of 3
             to figure out problems related to college students. My team started
             our design process with interviews and ended with a high fidelity prototype.

      <p class="header">PROBLEM</p>
      <p>Tension between roommates builds up when trash isn't taken out, dishes
         aren't cleaned, rent doesn't get payed, etc. These issues are due to
         poor household management stemming from miscommunication. How can we
         improve communication between roommates?
      </p>

      <p class="header">USER RESEARCH</p>
      <p>Each team member did an in-depth interview with a UCSD student about their
         housing situation, management and organization styles, and
         memorable/significant roommate stories they felt comfortable sharing. We chose these particular
         individuals to represent the diversity of housing situations—rooming with
         males vs females, the number of people you live with, and living in an
         apartment vs a house (note: the names were changed for privacy).
       </p>

       <img src="images/HappyHouse/interview-people.png" width=100% style="margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px">

       <p>Our interview questions:</p>
       <ul>
         <li>
           <p>Which chores are shared by everybody? Which chores are your own responsibility?</p>
         </li>
         <li>
           <p>How is it decided who does what chores? And when? Which chores do you not like to do?</p>
         </li>
         <li>
           <p>How do you typically communicate with your roommates?</p>
         </li>
         <li>
           <p>How do you pay your bills (rent, water, electricity, wifi)?</p>

      <p class="header">MAJOR INSIGHTS</p>

      <img src="images/HappyHouse/shared-chores.png" class="research-pic" style="margin-top: 30px;">
      <p><b>01. SHARED CHORES</b><br>We found that shared chores generally involve the communal living spaces,
         such as the kitchen and living room. So chores like taking out the trash
         and recycling, cleaning up the kitchen, and vacuuming are typically
         divided amongst roommates. The logic here is that since the space is shared
         its upkeep is shared as well.</p>

      <p><b>02. DISTRIBUTING RESPONSIBILITY</b><br>We identified two distinct styles for distributing chores with their
         main difference being how chores are
         assigned (see figure below). Each come with their own set of problems,
         but both heavily rely on an <i>expectation</i> that people are responsible and
         remember to do their chores. However there is no
         guarantee that people will contribute their fair share, which is why
         a system of reminders and way of holding people accountable is needed.</p>

         <!-- <p>Knowing that (not doing) chores is a common root of roommate conflicts,
            we analyzed how people typically distribute chores and were able to
            identify two distinct styles with their main difference being how chores are
            assigned (see figure below). Each come with their own set of problems,
            but both heavily rely on an expectation that people are responsible and
            remember to do their chores. However there is no
            guarantee that people will contribute their fair share, which is why
            a system of reminders and way of holding people accountable is needed.</p> -->

      <p class="img-caption">ways of distributing chores</p><br>

      <p>Another takeaway from our interviews was that messages about housing tend
         to get lost as they can easily go unnoticed amongst more exciting messages
         about a party, gossip, etc. Additionally, most interviewees said they used
         text and facebook messenger which makes messages getting lost even more likely
         as it can be hard to juggle between two apps. This presents a need for one
         system of communication that solely handles household aspects so that there's
         no other distractions.</p>

      <p>In summary, our interviews led us to focus on improving how roommates
         communicate household needs as this seems to be at the root of most of the problems we
         observed.</p>

        (and putting them on the floor because they wouldn't stick to the wall lol)</p><br>

      <p class="header">STORYBOARDS</p>
      <p>We constructed storyboards to help us come up with ideas on where we can
         target improving communication. Looking at scenarios roommates might
         encounter helped us narrow our
         ideas for what functionalities to include in our app. By addressing 3
         different problems, we were able to come up with 3 main functionalities
         for our app, which involves a chores tracker, creating house rules,
         and a chores reminder.</p>
      <img src="images/HappyHouse/Group.png" class="storyboard-pic" style="margin-top: 10px;">
      <p class="img-caption">storyboards of scenarios roommates might encounter</p>
      <br>
      <p><b>Chores Tracker</b>: The chore tracker storyboard was inspired by how
         house-related messages get lost or overlooked in the midst of other texts,
         Facebook messages, etc. We want to emphasize these messages by confining
         house-related chats to one app, so people don't have to mix house issues
         with other messages. We like this idea because it allows roommates to
         read a continuous house-related feed instead of having to scroll back
         through texts.
      </p>
      <p><b>House Rules</b>: Different understandings of how to do a chore can
         lead to unnecessary arguments over wrongful completions of that chore.
         The house rules storyboard centers around this need for a defined set
         of rules/steps, so that everyone is on the same page. We liked this idea
         because it helps hold roommates more accountable for doing a chore correctly,
         and it simply helps define a list of house rules and steps for chores
         that can easily be accessed.
      </p>
      <p><b>Chores Reminder</b>: Since chores aren't assigned using the tally chart
         method, this allows a lot of freedom and flexibility, which can be good,
         but can also be bad because you're relying on the idea that people will
         complete their fair share and will do so consistently. The dirty dishes
         storyboard includes a feature that helps assign specific chores to people
         and sends reminders, so that there is no confusion as to who is in charge
         of what and holds people accountable for doing their fair share.
      </p>

      <p class="header">WIREFRAMES</p>
      <p>With our main functionalities in mind, we thought of the user flow we wanted
         and sketched out some screens. In this user flow, we focused on creating and assigning tasks,
         as well as being able to set a reminder for a task.</p>

      <p class="header">USER TESTING</p>
      <p>With the wireframes we sketched out, we tested the interactions
         of our app with students. Below is a list of feedback we received in
         addition to observations we made.</p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-6">
          <b style="color: #99CED3">TO DO LIST</b>

            <li>"is there a message thread for each chore?"
            <li>don't want notifications sent each time a chore is completed!!!
            <li>"if you let people reject a chore that was assigned to them, it might
                 never get done"

          <b style="color: #99CED3">HOUSE RULES</b>
          <ul>

            <li>"wouldn't this go under schedules?"
          </ul><br>
        </div>
      </div>

        <p class="header">PROTOTYPE</p>
        <p>After reviewing the feedback we received from user testing, we made
           significant changes to our notification system, task creation functionality,
           and wording. These changes provide clarity for our user making their interactions
           with our app easier.</p>

         <!--HOME SCREEN-->
         <p class="header" style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 20px;">01. home screen</p>
         <p><b>Original</b>—During our user testing, many people mentioned wanting
            more updates, but failed to navigate to the <i>notifications</i> page
            which had these updates.</p>
         <p><b>Final</b>—Taking this into consideration, we removed the <i>notifications</i>
            page and put important updates on the <i>home</i> page itself so that
            users can see these notifications right when they open the app.</p>

        <p>Although we made some pretty significant changes, overall we kept the
           user flow relatively similar to our initial design. We made tweaks to
           improve the problems we observed but kept our focus on creating an
           easy-to-use communication system for housing needs.</p><br>

      <p class="header">REFLECTION</p>
      <p>Overall my team and I were really proud of our final design. Roommate
         conflicts are something that everyone experiences (you're lucky if you
         haven't lol), so we're glad we could create an app that a lot of people
         could use! I think my favorite part was probably doing user testing and
         realizing that features we thought were useful were not thought to be
         helpful for a lot of our testers. It really showed us that even though
         you design something with the user in mind, it might not actually be
         what the user wants/needs, which is why user testing is so important to
         validate our designs!</p>
