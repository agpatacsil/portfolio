      <h3>background</h3>
      <p>Technology like continuous glucose monitors (CGM) and insulin pumps make
        large amounts of data available to people with diabetes. Access to this
        data helps people better understand how diabetes affects their body which
        allows them to manage it more effectively.</p>
      <p><img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./assets/images/insulearn/overwhelm.png"></p>
      <p style="padding-top: 10px">But first they need to learn how to interpret and use this data, and that starts with having a good understanding of the core concepts of diabetes... and that's where we run into trouble!</p>

    </div>

    <div class="section-container-spacer">
      <h3>the problem</h3>
      <p>There is <i>A LOT</i> to learn about diabetes and how to manage it â€”
        from monitoring blood glucose levels and deciding when to take your insulin,
        counting carbs for complex meals and using formulas, staying physically
        active, the list goes on and on. So how do people learn about diabetes?</p>
      <p><img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./assets/images/insulearn/learning.png"></p>
      <p>There are a ton of books and online resources, but they're very text
        heavy with a lot of terminology and formulas that can be very hard to
        understand without guideance. People can also learn from health professionals,
        like diabetes educators. Getting to interact with an "expert" and have
        them explain these concepts can be really helpful and much easier than
        reading a paper, but they're not always available to talk with you. These
        problems led my team to this question:</p>
      <p style="font-size: 20px"><i>Can we make learning diabetes concepts more interactive and less focused on numbers and text? ðŸ¤” ðŸ’­</i></p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-container-spacer">
      <h3>user research</h3>
      <p>We interviewed <b>4 people with diabetes</b> and <b>2 health professionals</b>
        to gain insight on their experience with diabetes education and what
        they consider to be the most important diabetes concepts to learn. Here
        are some of the major insights:</p>
      <p><img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./assets/images/insulearn/interviews.png" style="padding-top: 5px"></p><br>
      <p>From these interviews, we found that learning how to dose insulin at
        meals (e.g. prebolusing) to be one of the most important concepts to learn,
        while also being one of the hardest! To make this concept easier to understand,
        health professionals use simple visual aids (e.g. hand drawn graphs) with
        their explanations. These visual aids are really helpful, but repeatedly
        hand drawing them out is tedious and it's only provided during 1:1 education
        with health professionals, which isn't accessible to everyone! For these
        reasons, my team wants to:</p><br>
      <p style="font-size: 20px">ðŸŒ€ Focus on teaching how to dose insulin at meals (e.g. prebolusing)</p>
      <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-top: -15px">ðŸŒ€ Provide interactive visualizations to support explanations</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-container-spacer">
      <h3>ideation</h3>
      <p><img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./assets/images/insulearn/crazy8.png"></p>
      <p style="padding-top: 10px">Now that we had our focus, we each sketched 8 different ideas in 8 minutes
        (aka Crazy 8's ideating). Here are the top 3 ideas from all our sketches:</p>
      <p style="padding-top: 10px"><img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./assets/images/insulearn/ideas.png"></p>
      <ul style="padding-top: 10px">
        <li><b>Inputting Personal Data</b> â€” Users can generate a 24 hour glucose
          graph based on age, weight, and gender then input meals, workouts, and
          insulin doses to see how the glucose curve changes</li>
        <li><b>Manually Sliding Graph</b> â€” Users can generate a random glucose curve
          for a random meal then use sliders to change when and how much insulin gets added</li>
        <li><b>Choose Your Own Adventure</b> â€” Users pick a storyline and make
          decisions that determine the character's actions. At the end, they'll
          see the 24 hour glucose graph that reflects all the decisions they made</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="padding-top: 10px">After discussing these concepts as a team and
        with our mentors, we decided to pursue the <b>manually sliding graphs</b>! This
        design easily let's people see how different insulin doses change the
        glucose curve, which we think will be the most intuitive and effective
        way for teaching how to dose insulin at meals.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-container-spacer">
      <h3>early prototypes</h3>
      <p>We used Figma to build our wireframes and early prototypes. Users could
        click through an optional tutorial that walks them through an example
        while pointing out the graph's features, providing definitions, and
        including disclaimers about our tool through a series of pop-ups.</p>
      <div class="row" style="text-align: center">
          <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
            <p><img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./assets/gif/tutorial.gif" style="box-shadow: 0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1), 0 6px 20px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)"></p>
            <h5 style="padding-top: 10px">The Tutorial</h5>
          </div>
          <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
            <p><img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./assets/gif/sliders.gif" style="box-shadow: 0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1), 0 6px 20px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)"></p>
            <h5 style="padding-top: 10px">The Interactive Graph</h5>
          </div>
      </div>
      <p style="padding-top: 10px">After the tutorial, users can choose from multiple starting graphs that
      show the glucose curve of different scenarios. They can use the insulin
      time and dose sliders to directly see how different insulin doses affect
      the glucose curve. The time in range can be found above the graph, since
      it's becoming more used in diabetes management and it gives people a
      general idea if their adjustments are improving the glucose curve.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-container-spacer">
      <h3>adding color</h3>
      <p>Most health related companies use cool tones like blue and green to
        relay a sense of trustworthiness and professionalism, which is why we
        chose a color scheme revolving around the color teal. We also chose yellow
        for the target range's upper threshold line and red for the lower as those
        colors are typically associated with going high and going low respectively.</p>
      <p><img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./assets/images/insulearn/style.png"></p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-container-spacer">
      <h3>user testing + key takeaways</h3>
      <p>After creating a user testing plan and building out a testing environment
        in Figma, we tested our prototype with <b>5 people with diabetes</b> and
        <b>4 health professionals</b>! The focus for testing was to validate the
        design as an effective teaching tool and to work out any usability issues.
        Here are some of the key takeaways:</p><br>

      <b style="color: black">01 Graph titles don't match the graph once the insulin dose changes</b>
      <p>For example, this starting graph is titled "forgetting to bolus" with
        the graph below to match it. If users move the sliders so that they dose
        insulin 15 minutes before the meal, the graph now has insulin on it.
        However the graph is still titled "forgetting to bolus", which testers
        understandably found confusing.</p>
      <p><img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./assets/images/insulearn/scenarios.png"></p>
      <p><b>Solution</b>: Reframe the graph titles to be more general and topic
        based. For example, change the "Forgetting to bolus" title to "Insulin
        timing and dosing"</p><br>

      <b style="color: black">02 Our tool should be easy to understand without a tutorial</b>
      <p>With a lot of feedback to add more definitions and disclaimers to our
        tutorial, it was getting really long, meaning users had to click through
        a lot of pop-ups which no one likes to do! So as a team we took a step
        back, remembered that we set a goal to make a tool that's simple and easy
        to use and came to the conclusion that we shouldn't even need a tutorial.</p>
      <p><img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./assets/images/insulearn/lessons.png"></p>
      <p><b>Solution</b>: Testers liked the definitions and disclaimers found in
        the tutorial, so we moved them into a supplementary lessons page focused
        on providing general diabetes information</p><br>


      <b style="color: black">03 How can we show the potential of insulin better?</b>
      <p>Testers wondered if we could better visualize the insulin activity because
        right now itâ€™s "just a curve that lies on top of the glucose."</p>
      <p><img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./assets/images/insulearn/visual.png"></p>
      <p><b>Solution</b>: Add visual indicators: 1) shade in the insulin activity
        curve, 2) add vertical line along bolus and meal points, and 3) add bolus
        time in relation to meal time above time slider thumb</p><br>


      <b style="color: black">04 Provide direction when the glucose curve goes above 180 or below 70 mg/dL</b>
      <p>A teaching point for this tool is if you correctly time and dose your
        insulin, you'll be able to stay within target range after you eat. Testers
        pointed out that this goal of staying within target range is never stated,
        so people who are new to diabetes may not naturally have that goal in mind.</p>
      <p><img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./assets/images/insulearn/direction.png"></p>
      <p><b>Solution</b>: When the glucose curve goes above 180 and/or below 70
        mg/dL, a pop-up directing users to adjust the insulin to move into target
        range will appear</p>

      <h3>the final design</h3>
      <p style="padding-bottom: 10px">After iterating on the user testing insights, I worked with Vidya to code
        the final design in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. <a href="http://ddi.ucsd.edu/learn/" target="_blank"><u>View the website</u></a></p>

    <div class="section-container-spacer">
      <h3>next steps</h3>
      <p>We were fortunate to test our design with people who are very knowledgable
        about diabetes, which helped us validate the information we were incorporating
        into our tool. For next steps, we'd love to test with people who are newly
        diagnosed and/or new to CGM/insulin pumps to validate that that using this
        tool is an effective and easier way to learn about insulin dosing. Additionally,
        we see this project as just the first step in the journey of interactive
        diabetes education. There are so many other topics and factors to that we
        didn't get to cover, like pump settings, stress, carb counting, pregnancy,
        complex meals, etc. that we'd love to explore and see if we can visualize
        them in a way that makes them easier to learn!</p>
