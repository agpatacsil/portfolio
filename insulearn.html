      <div >
      <p class="header" style="margin-top: 40px">Background</p>
      <p>Technology like continuous glucose monitors (CGM) and insulin
        pumps make large amounts of data available to people with diabetes. Access
        to this data helps people better understand how diabetes affects their body which
        allows them to manage it more effectively.</p><br>
      <img src="assets/img/insulearn/overwhelm.png" width="100%"><br><br><br>
      <p>But first they need to learn <i>how</i> to interpret and use this data,
        and that starts with having a good understanding of the core concepts of diabetes... and that's
        where we run into trouble!</p>
      </div>


      <div >
      <p class="header">The Problem</p>
      <p>There is <i>A LOT</i> to learn about diabetes and how to manage it — from
        monitoring blood glucose levels and deciding when to take your insulin,
        counting carbs for complex meals and using formulas, staying physically
        active, the list goes on and on. So how do people learn about diabetes?</p><br>
      <img src="assets/img/insulearn/learning.png" width="100%"><br><br>
      <p>There are a ton of books and online resources, but they're very text
        heavy with a lot of terminology and formulas that can be very hard to
        understand without guideance. People can also learn from health professionals,
        like diabetes educators. Getting to interact with an "expert" and have
        them explain these concepts can be really helpful and much easier
        than reading a paper, but they're not always available to talk with you.
        These problems led my team to this question:</p><br>
      <b style="font-size: 20px;"><i>Can we make learning diabetes concepts more
        interactive and less focused on numbers and text?</i> 🤔 💭</b>
      </div>

      <div >
      <p class="header">User Research</p>
      <p>We interviewed <b style="font-weight: 500">4 people with diabetes</b>
        and <b style="font-weight: 500">2 health professionals</b> to gain
        insight on their experience with diabetes education and what they consider
        to be the most important diabetes concepts to learn. Here are some of
        the major insights:</p><br>

      <img src="assets/img/insulearn/interviews.png" width="100%"><br><br><br>
      <p>From these interviews, we found that learning how to dose insulin at
        meals (e.g. prebolusing) to be one of the most important concepts to learn,
        while also being one of the hardest! To make this concept easier to understand,
        health professionals use simple visual aids (e.g. hand drawn graphs) with
        their explanations. These visual aids are really helpful, but repeatedly
        hand drawing them out is tedious and it's only provided during 1:1 education
        with health professionals, which isn't accessible to everyone! For these reasons, my team wants to:</p><br>
      <b style="font-size: 20px;">🌀 Focus on teaching how to dose insulin at meals
         <b style="font-weight: 500">(e.g. prebolusing)</b></b><br>
      <b style="font-size: 20px;">🌀 Provide interactive visualizations to support explanations</b>
    </div>

    <div >
      <p class="header">Ideation</p>
      <img src="assets/img/insulearn/crazy8.png" width="100%"><br><br><br>
      <p>Now that we had our focus, we each sketched 8 different ideas in 8 minutes
        (aka Crazy 8's ideating). Here are the top 3 ideas from all our sketches:</p><br>
      <img src="assets/img/insulearn/ideas.png" width="100%"><br><br>
      <ul>
        <li><b style="font-weight: 500">Inputting Personal Data</b> — Users can
          generate a 24 hour glucose graph based on age, weight, and gender then
          input meals, workouts, and insulin doses to see how the glucose curve
          changes</li>
        <li><b style="font-weight: 500">Manually Sliding Graph</b> — Users can
          generate a random glucose curve for a random meal then use sliders to
          change when and how much insulin gets added</li>
        <li><b style="font-weight: 500">Choose Your Own Adventure</b> — Users
          pick a storyline and make decisions that determine the character's
          actions. At the end, they'll see the 24 hour glucose graph that reflects
          all the decisions they made</li>
      </ul><br>
      <p>After discussing these concepts as a team and with our mentors, we decided
         to pursue the <b style="font-weight: 500">manually sliding graphs</b>!
         This design easily let's people see how different insulin doses change
         the glucose curve, which we think will be the most intuitive and effective
         way for teaching how to dose insulin at meals.</p>
      </div>


      <div >
      <p class="header">Early Prototypes</p>
      <p>We used Figma to build our wireframes and early prototypes. Users could
        click through an optional tutorial that walks them through an example
        while pointing out the graph's features, providing definitions, and
        including disclaimers about our tool through a series of pop-ups.</p><br>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-6" style="padding: 5px">
          <img src="assets/gif/tutorial.gif" width="100%" style="box-shadow: 0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1), 0 6px 20px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);"><br><br>
          <center><b style="font-weight: 500">The Tutorial</b></center>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-6" style="padding: 5px">
          <img src="assets/gif/sliders.gif" width="100%" style="box-shadow: 0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1), 0 6px 20px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);"><br><br>
          <center><b style="font-weight: 500">The Interactive Graph</b></center>
        </div>
      </div><br>
      <p>After the tutorial, users can choose from multiple starting
         graphs that show the glucose curve of different scenarios. They can use
         the insulin time and dose sliders to directly see how different insulin
         doses affect the glucose curve. The time in range can be found above the
         graph, since it's becoming more used in diabetes management and it gives
         people a general idea if their adjustments are improving the glucose curve.</p>
      </div>

      <div >
      <p class="header">Adding color</p>
      <p>Most health related companies use cool tones like blue and green to
         relay a sense of trustworthiness and professionalism, which is why
         we chose a color scheme revolving around the color teal. We also chose
         yellow for the target range's upper threshold line and red for the lower
         as those colors are typically associated with going high and going low respectively.</p><br>
      <img src="assets/img/insulearn/style.png" width="100%">
    </div>


    <div >
      <p class="header">User testing & key takeaways</p>
      <p>After creating a user testing plan and building out a testing environment
         in Figma, we tested our prototype with <b style="font-weight: 500">5 people
         with diabetes</b> and <b style="font-weight: 500">4 health professionals</b>!
         The focus for testing was to validate the design as an effective teaching
         tool and to work out any usability issues. Here are some of the key takeaways:</p><br>

      <b>1. Graph titles don't match the graph once the insulin dose changes</b>
      <p style="padding-left: 20px">For example, this starting graph is titled
        "forgetting to bolus" with the graph below to match it. If users move the
        sliders so that they dose insulin 15 minutes before the meal, the graph
        now has insulin on it. However the graph is still titled "forgetting to
        bolus", which testers understandably found confusing.</p>
      <img src="assets/img/insulearn/scenarios.png" width="100%"><br><br>
      <p style="padding-left: 20px"><b>Solution</b>: Reframe the graph titles to
        be more general and topic based. For example, change the "Forgetting to
        bolus" title to "Insulin timing and dosing"</p>
      <br><br><br>

      <b>2. Our tool should be easy to understand without a tutorial</b>
      <p style="padding-left: 20px">With a lot of feedback to add more definitions
        and disclaimers to our tutorial, it was getting really long, meaning
        users had to click through a lot of pop-ups which no one likes to do!
        So as a team we took a step back, remembered that we set a goal to make
        a tool that's simple and easy to use and came to the conclusion that we
        shouldn't even need a tutorial.</p>
      <img src="assets/img/insulearn/lessons.png" width="100%"><br><br>
      <p style="padding-left: 20px"><b>Solution</b>: Testers liked the definitions
        and disclaimers found in the tutorial, so we moved them into a supplementary
        lessons page focused on providing general diabetes information</p>
      <br><br><br>

      <b>3. How can we show the potential of insulin better?</b>
      <p style="padding-left: 20px">Testers wondered if we could better visualize
        the insulin activity because right now it’s "just a curve that lies on top of
        the glucose."</p>
      <img src="assets/img/insulearn/visual.png" width="100%"><br><br>
      <p style="padding-left: 20px"><b>Solution</b>: Add visual indicators: 1)
        shade in the insulin activity curve, 2) add vertical line along bolus and
        meal points, and 3) add bolus time in relation to meal time above time
        slider thumb</p>
      <br><br><br>

      <b>4. Provide direction when the glucose curve goes above 180 or below 70 mg/dL</b>
      <p style="padding-left: 20px">A teaching point for this tool is if you
        correctly time and dose your insulin, you'll be able to stay within target
        range after you eat. Testers pointed out that this goal of staying within
        target range is never stated, so people who are new to diabetes may not
        naturally have that goal in mind.</p>
      <img src="assets/img/insulearn/direction.png" width="100%"><br><br>
      <p style="padding-left: 20px"><b>Solution</b>: When the glucose curve goes
        above 180 and/or below 70 mg/dL, a pop-up directing users to adjust the
        insulin to move into target range will appear</p>
      </div>

      <div >
      <p class="header">The final design</p>
      <p>After iterating on the user testing insights, I worked with Vidya
        to code the final design in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can access the final website <a href="http://ddi.ucsd.edu/learn/" target="_blank">here</a>!</p>
      <br>

    <div >
      <p class="header">Next steps</p>
      <p>We were fortunate to test our design with people who are very knowledgable
         about diabetes, which helped us validate the information we were incorporating
         into our tool. For next steps, we'd love to test with people who are
         newly diagnosed and/or new to CGM/insulin pumps to validate that that
         using this tool is an effective and easier way to learn about insulin dosing.
         Additionally, we see this project as just the first step in the journey
         of interactive diabetes education. There are so many other topics and
         factors to that we didn't get to cover, like pump settings, stress, carb
         counting, pregnancy, complex meals, etc. that we'd love to explore and
         see if we can visualize them in a way that makes them easier to learn!</p>
