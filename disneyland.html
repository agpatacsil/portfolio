        <p >The Disneyland app was released to make park visits even more magical!
          With the app, you can buy tickets, check wait times, locate favorite
          characters, make dining plans, and much more. <br><br>While these features
          are useful in <i>theory</i>, my team—as park visitors and users of the app—have
          personally experienced confusion and frustration trying to navigate the app.
          We want to redesign the app so Disneyland’s 51,000 daily park visitors
          have easier and more delightful app experiences so they can fully enjoy
          their time at the happiest place on Earth!</p>
      </div>

        <img src="assets/img/Disney/project-timeline.png" width=100% style="margin-top: 10px"><br>
      </div>

      <div >
        <p class="header" >RESEARCH</p>
        <p>We started by identifying general pain points to further explore during
          our interviews and usability testing. Our teammate Kristen, a cast member
          at Disneyland, reached out on Instagram to gather thoughts on the app from
          her followers:</p>
        <img src="assets/img/Disney/ig-responses.png" width=100% style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 30px">
        <p>In addition to collecting these responses, we each performed a deep dive
          into the app to uncover confusing components. Through all these explorations,
          we identified <b><u>four major pain points</u></b>:</p>
        <img src="assets/img/Disney/4-pain-points.png" width=100% style="margin-top: 20px;">
      </div>


      <div >
        <p class="header" >INTERVIEWS</p>
        <p>As Disneyland attracts thousands of visitors every day, there's a wide
          range of expertise when it comes to the app. We wanted to represent this
          diversity in our interview participants, which is why we decided on these
          <b><u>four main users</u></b>:
         </p>
        <img src="assets/img/Disney/types-of-users.png" width=100% ><br><br>
        <p >As we had limited time for this project, each team member interviewed
          one of the four main users. Our chosen participants came from all walks
          of life, aging 20 to 28, but our selection may be limited because we
          didn't explicitly consider tech saviness, which may have influenced one’s
          app experience. I interviewed someone who hadn’t been to the parks since
          the app was released, so I collected insights on how a first time user
          familiarizes themself with the app!<br><br>

          The interview was semi-structured with open-ended questions and a user
          testing portion. We started with demographic questions to learn about
          their background and experience with the app and Disneyland overall.
          For the user testing, participants were asked to think aloud while they
          completed 4 tasks—each one highlighting one of the 4 major pain points.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/img/Disney/Planning.png" width=100% style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px" >
        <p class="img-caption" >example—this task provided insight on how people
          use the app to plan their day in the park
        </p>
      </div>


      <div >
        <p class="header" >INTERVIEW RESULTS</p>
        <p >After conducting our interviews, we found that users repeatedly
          struggled when tasks involved the map page, particularly discovering
          the useful features behind the map's default settings. Specifically the
          <i>Filter</i>, <i>Category Selection</i>, and <i>Show List</i> features went unnoticed.
         </p>
        <img src="assets/img/Disney/map-page-issue.png" width=100% ><br><br>
        <p >As a result of missing these features, users found the map's information
          lacking and navigated away to the search page. While they could insert
          any key word, the search feature has its limitations for what information
          it brings up. For example, my interviewee struggled to locate Elsa for one
          of the user testing tasks. On the map page, he didn't notice the dropdown
          to change the category from <i>Attractions</i> to <i>Characters</i>, so he went to the
          search page to type in Elsa. However, character information is only
          available on the map page, so his search failed.<br><br>

          Furthermore, Tiffany pointed out that the map allows users to visualize
          the locations of multiple landmarks, as well as browse a list of ones for
          those who don’t have something specific to search for. For these reasons,
          we see the map's usefulness and potential to have strong impact for users,
          which is why <b>our focus will be to make the map page’s features—filter,
          category selection, list view—more easily discoverable.</b>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div >
        <p class="header" >COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</p>
        <p >We examined how other apps handle their map pages and relevant features,
          especially how easily landmark categories and filters can be accessed. I
          headed the competitive analysis of the Universal Studios app.
         </p>
        <img src="assets/img/Disney/competitive-analysis.png" width=100% ><br><br>
        <p >After we tried all of their features, I summarized our findings into
          key takeaways that we incorporated during our ideation phase:
        </p>
        <ul >
          <li>
            <p><b>Apple Maps</b> functionalities are clearly labed and easily
              discoverable! It provides flexibility and efficiency by giving users
              the option to either search or browse for their destination.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><b>Universal Studios</b> makes adding and removing categories to
              the map and list view easily accessible and intuitive with the top bar.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><b>Six Flags</b> makes adding and removing categories to the map
              and list view easily accessible and intuitive with the top bar.
              However it is restrictive in regards to accessing detailed information
              from the map view.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div >
        <p class="header" >SKETCHES</p>
        <p >Incorporating our user testing findings and competitive analysis insights,
          each team member sketched their ideal redesign for the map page with a
          focus on <b><u>discoverability</u></b>:
         </p>
        <img src="assets/img/Disney/Sketches.png" width=100% ><br><br>
        <p >Here are the main features of our sketches:</p>
        <ul >
          <li>
            <p><b>Allison</b>—Row of category icons are horizontally scrollable
              (inspired by SixFlags and Instagram). Center Filter and Show List
              and add their respective icons. List view is sortable.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><b>Nessa</b>—Category icons are laid out in a column. Search function
              is added to the top bar. Add Draw function to select map regions.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><b>Tiffany</b>—Categories are listed in a pull-up panel. Increase text
              size for Filter and Show List.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><b>Kristen</b>—Categories are listed in left column. Other important
              information in right column. Users can easily access their frequently
              used items.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p >After discussing the strengths and weaknesses of our sketches, we further
          developed two features of our sketches that best help users discover the
          map's features—my category icons and sortable list & Tiffany’s pull-up panel.
          As a result, we developed two distinct high fidelity prototypes in Figma.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div >
         <p class="header" >HIGH FIDELITY PROTOTYPE 1</p>
         <p >The first prototype was headed by Tiffany and Nessa. It maintains the
           simple aesthetic and layout of the original design, but adds a bottom
           pull-up panel inspired by Apple Maps to make <i>Category Selection</i> more noticeable.
           <br><br>In this design, the panel slides up when the user first navigates to the
             map page and will only collapse once a category is selected. This is done
             intentionally to make users aware of the available categories, since many
             users didn't know there were options other than <i>Attractions</i>. Additionally,
             the size and weight of the <i>Filter</i> and <i>Show List</i> buttons were increased due
             to our interview participants failing to notice them during testing.
         </p><br>
         <div class="row" >
           <div class="col-sm-6" style="margin-bottom: 10px">
             <img class="gifs" src="assets/gif/disney-panel.gif" style="max-width: 275px"><br>
             <center><p style="max-width: 275px; font-size: 12px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.3;">The panel slides up when the user first
               navigates to the map page making them aware of the different categories.
               It will only collapse once they select a category.</p></center>
           </div>
           <div class="col-sm-6" style="margin-bottom: 10px">
             <img class="gifs" src="assets/gif/disney-search.gif" style="max-width: 275px"><br>
             <center><p style="max-width: 275px; font-size: 12px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.3;">Users can slide the panel up to change the category or use the
               panel's search function by clicking the search bar.</p></center>
           </div>
         </div><br>
         <p >And the most distinct aspect of this prototype was the inclusion of a
           search bar in the pull-up panel. We noticed that some interview participants
           relied heavily on the search function to find characters, look up ride times,
           find restaurants, etc. We opted to make this popular feature more accessible
           but still unobtrusive by placing it in the categories panel. With this feature,
           users who are looking for something specific can quickly obtain the information
           and carry on with their Disneyland trip instead of navigating between the map
           and search page.
         </p>
      </div>

      <div >
         <p class="header" >HIGH FIDELITY PROTOTYPE 2</p>
         <p >Our second prototype was headed by myself and Nessa! It aims to let
           users select and sort the information they most care about by improving
           discoverability and efficiency. <br><br>In this design, I made the ability to
            change categories easily discoverable by replacing
             the dropdown with a row of category icons. Users can horizontally scroll
             to view additional categories and this functionality is made apparent by
             having the rightmost icon halfway on the page. When users click an icon,
             it highlights blue to show that the category is active and the respective
             landmark pins populate the map. Additionally, I positioned <i>Filter</i> and
             <i>Show List</i> centered below the row of icons to increase their visibility.
          </p><br>
         <div class="row" >
           <div class="col-sm-6" style="margin-bottom: 10px">
             <img class="gifs" src="assets/gif/disney-multiple.gif" style="max-width: 275px"><br>
             <center><p style="max-width: 275px; font-size: 12px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.3;">
               Users can scroll through the row of category icons and select ones
               they want to view on the map by clicking their icon. Multiple
               categories can be selected.</p></center>
           </div>
           <div class="col-sm-6" style="margin-bottom: 10px">
             <img class="gifs" src="assets/gif/disney-sort.gif" style="max-width: 275px"><br>
             <center><p style="max-width: 275px; font-size: 12px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.3;">
               When "Show List" is clicked, a panel slides up with list items
               arranged alphabetically by default. With the "Sort By" menu, users
               can change how the list is sorted.</p></center>
           </div>
         </div><br>
         <p >When users click <i>Show List</i>, a panel slides up from the bottom of the
           page containing the list. In the original design, the list is ordered
           alphabetically which doesn’t cater to what users care about (e.g. wait
           time and distance). My solution was to add a sort feature that allows
           users to sort the list (i.e. A to Z, Category, Distance, Wait Time).<br><br>

          In addition to changing categories, we decided to allow users to have
          multiple categories active at once. This saves users time by not having
          to go back and forth between categories. Instead they can look at all the
          information they need at once! And if the map becomes overwhelming with
          so many pins, they can simply reduce the number of active categories.
         </p>
       </div>


       <div >
         <p class="header" >USER TESTING</p>
         <p >The overall goal of our user testing was to answer these two questions:
         </p>
          <ul >
            <li>
              <p>Are the map page's features—filter, category selection, list
                view—easily discoverable?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>How effective are the new features (search in prototype 1 & sort
                in prototype 2)?</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p >Due to limited time, we used a between-subjects design with 4 new
            participants. In other words, both prototypes were tested by an experienced
            and novice user. I tested a novice user with the prototype I created—prototype 2!
          </p>
         <img src="assets/img/Disney/participants-2.png" width=100% style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 30px" >
         <p >Similar to our initial interview, we started with demographic questions
           to understand their background and experience with the app and Disneyland
           overall. Participants were asked to think aloud while they completed 2
           tasks—each one designed to have participants use the map's features beyond
           the default settings. For example, one of our tasks was to find Elsa—can
           you tell we LOVE Elsa—because finding character's was a huge pain point
           in our initial interviews.</p>
         <img src="assets/img/Disney/map-character-task.png" width=100% style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px" >
         <p class="img-caption" >example—this task provided insight on how
           discoverable <i>Category Selection</i> is
         </p>
       </div>

       <div >
         <p class="header" >USER TESTING RESULTS</p>
         <img src="assets/img/Disney/user-testing-results.png" width=100% style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 30px" >
         <p >Our user testing showed that both prototypes made the map page's
           features more discoverable, especially for <i>Category Selection</i>—with
           prototype one's bottom panel and prototype two's scrollable row of
           icons! However we concluded our best option would be to pursue prototype
           2 for the following reasons:
         </p>
         <ul >
           <li>
             <p>Experienced users were confused why there were 2 search bars in
               prototype one and wondered how they were different</p>
           </li>
           <li>
             <p>Users have to know what they want to search to utilize prototype
               one's search bar, whereas prototype two's sortable list allows
               efficient browsing</p>
           </li>
           <li>
             <p>The list's different sorting options let's users sort the list in
               a way that matters to them (e.g. wait time, distance)!</p>
           </li>
           <li>
             <p>Selecting multiple categories improves efficiency—don't have to
               switch between categories & can populate map with all categories
               they care about</p>
           </li>
           <li>
             <p>Changing categories is easier in prototype two since the row of
               icons are always present, while the ability is hidden in prototype
               one's bottom panel</p>

         <p class="header" >REFLECTIONS + LESSONS LEARNED</p>
         <p >As a HUGE Disney lover, I was super passionate about this project and
           wanted this redesign to be the best it could! To make our high fidelity
           prototype, I spent so many hours learning Figma so I could make the design
           I pictured in my head, and the sleep deprivation was totally worth it!
           And to my amazing teammates, I learned so much from them and couldn't
           have done it without them—from Nessa's Figma expertise and Kristen's Disney
           connections to Tiffany's aesthetic and thoughtfulness.<br><br>

           Most importantly, I learned a lot about understanding the viewpoints of
           different users and seeing how experience shapes how one uses the app.
           For instance, a cast member who uses the app daily saw different problems
           than someone who had never seen the app, which we were able to discover
           because we took the time to carefully select our participants and craft
           our questions and tasks. So my biggest takeaway is that good interviews
           will greatly help you discover important insights!
