      <h3>problem</h3>
      <p>The Disneyland app was released to make park visits even more magical!
        With the app, you can buy tickets, check wait times, locate favorite characters,
        make dining plans, and much more. While these features are useful in theory,
        my team—as park visitors and users of the app—have personally experienced
        confusion and frustration trying to navigate the app. We want to redesign
        the app so Disneyland’s 51,000 daily park visitors have easier and more
        delightful app experiences so they can fully enjoy their time at the
        happiest place on Earth!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-container-spacer">
      <h3>project process</h3>
      <p><img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./assets/images/Disney/project-timeline.png"></p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-container-spacer">
      <h3>research</h3>
      <p>We started by identifying general pain points to further explore during
        our interviews and usability testing. Our teammate Kristen, a cast member
        at Disneyland, reached out on Instagram to gather thoughts on the app
        from her followers:</p>
      <p><img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./assets/images/Disney/ig-responses.png" style="padding-top: 5px"></p><br>
      <p>In addition to collecting these responses, we each performed a deep
        dive into the app to uncover confusing components. Through all these
        explorations, we identified <u>four major pain points</u>:</p><br>
      <p><img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./assets/images/Disney/4-pain-points.png"></p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-container-spacer">
      <h3>interviews</h3>
      <p>As Disneyland attracts thousands of visitors every day, there's a wide
        range of expertise when it comes to the app. We wanted to represent this
        diversity in our interview participants, which is why we decided on these
        <u>four main users</u>:</p>
      <p><img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./assets/images/Disney/types-of-users.png"></p>
      <p>As we had limited time for this project, each team member interviewed
        one of the four main users. Our chosen participants came from all walks
        of life, aging 20 to 28, but our selection may be limited because we
        didn't explicitly consider tech saviness, which may have influenced one’s
        app experience. I interviewed someone who hadn’t been to the parks since
        the app was released, so I collected insights on how a first time user
        familiarizes themself with the app!</p>
      <p style="padding-top: 10px">The interview was semi-structured with open-ended questions and a user
        testing portion. We started with demographic questions to learn about
        their background and experience with the app and Disneyland overall. For
        the user testing, participants were asked to think aloud while they
        completed 4 tasks—each one highlighting one of the 4 major pain points.</p><br>
      <p><img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./assets/images/Disney/Planning.png"></p>
      <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 13px">example—this task provided insight on how people use the app to plan their day in the park</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-container-spacer">
      <h3>interview results</h3>
      <p>After conducting our interviews, we found that users repeatedly struggled
        when tasks involved the map page, particularly discovering the useful
        features behind the map's default settings. Specifically the <i>Filter</i>,
        <i>Category Selection</i>, and <i>Show List</i> features went unnoticed.</p>
      <p><img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./assets/images/Disney/map-page-issue.png" style="padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px"></p>
      <p>As a result of missing these features, users found the map's information
        lacking and navigated away to the search page. While they could insert
        any key word, the search feature has its limitations for what information
        it brings up. For example, my interviewee struggled to locate Elsa for
        one of the user testing tasks. On the map page, he didn't notice the
        dropdown to change the category from <i>Attractions</i> to <i>Characters</i>, so he
        went to the search page to type in Elsa. However, character information
        is only available on the map page, so his search failed.</p>
      <p style="padding-top: 10px">Furthermore, Tiffany pointed out that the map allows users to visualize
        the locations of multiple landmarks, as well as browse a list of ones
        for those who don’t have something specific to search for. For these
        reasons, we see the map's usefulness and potential to have strong impact
        for users, which is why our focus will be to make the map page’s
        features—filter, category selection, list view—more easily discoverable.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-container-spacer">
      <h3>competitive analysis</h3>
      <p>We examined how other apps handle their map pages and relevant features,
        especially how easily landmark categories and filters can be accessed.
        I headed the competitive analysis of the Universal Studios app.</p><br>
      <p><img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./assets/images/Disney/competitive-analysis.png"></p><br>
      <p>After we tried all of their features, I summarized our findings into
        key takeaways that we incorporated during our ideation phase:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Apple Maps functionalities are clearly labed and easily discoverable!
          It provides flexibility and efficiency by giving users the option to
          either search or browse for their destination.</li>
        <li>Universal Studios makes adding and removing categories to the map
          and list view easily accessible and intuitive with the top bar.</li>
        <li>Six Flags makes adding and removing categories to the map and list
          view easily accessible and intuitive with the top bar. However it is
          restrictive in regards to accessing detailed information from the map
          view.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section-container-spacer">
      <h3>sketches</h3>
      <p>Incorporating our user testing findings and competitive analysis insights,
        each team member sketched their ideal redesign for the map page with a
        focus on <u>discoverability</u>:</p><br>
      <p><img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./assets/images/Disney/Sketches.png"></p><br>
      <p>Here are the main features of our sketches:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Allison—Row of category icons are horizontally scrollable (inspired
          by SixFlags and Instagram). Center Filter and Show List and add their
          respective icons. List view is sortable.</li>
        <li>Nessa—Category icons are laid out in a column. Search function is
          added to the top bar. Add Draw function to select map regions.</li>
        <li>Tiffany—Categories are listed in a pull-up panel. Increase text size
          for Filter and Show List.</li>
        <li>Kristen—Categories are listed in left column. Other important
          information in right column. Users can easily access their frequently
          used items.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>After discussing the strengths and weaknesses of our sketches, we further
        developed two features of our sketches that best help users discover the
        map's features—my category icons and sortable list & Tiffany’s pull-up
        panel. As a result, we developed two distinct high fidelity prototypes
        in Figma.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-container-spacer">
      <h3>high fidelity prototype 1</h3>
      <p>The first prototype was headed by Tiffany and Nessa. It maintains the
        simple aesthetic and layout of the original design, but adds a bottom
        pull-up panel inspired by Apple Maps to make <i>Category Selection</i> more
        noticeable.</p>
      <p style="padding-top: 10px">In this design, the panel slides up when the
        user first navigates to the map page and will only collapse once a category
        is selected. This is done intentionally to make users aware of the available
        categories, since many users didn't know there were options other than
        <i>Attractions</i>. Additionally, the size and weight of the <i>Filter</i> and <i>Show
        List</i> buttons were increased due to our interview participants failing
        to notice them during testing.</p><br>
      <div class="row">
          <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-5">
            <p><img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./assets/gif/disney-panel.gif"></p>
            <p style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.2">The panel slides up when
              the user first navigates to the map page making them aware of the
              different categories. It will only collapse once they select a category.</p><br>
          </div>
          <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-1">
          </div>
          <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-5">
            <p><img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./assets/gif/disney-search.gif"></p>
            <p style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.2">Users can slide the panel
              up to change the category or use the panel's search function by
              clicking the search bar.</p><br>
          </div>
      </div>
      <p>And the most distinct aspect of this prototype was the inclusion of a
        search bar in the pull-up panel. We noticed that some interview participants
        relied heavily on the search function to find characters, look up ride times,
        find restaurants, etc. We opted to make this popular feature more accessible
        but still unobtrusive by placing it in the categories panel. With this
        feature, users who are looking for something specific can quickly obtain
        the information and carry on with their Disneyland trip instead of
        navigating between the map and search page.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-container-spacer">
      <h3>high fidelity prototype 2</h3>
      <p>Our second prototype was headed by myself and Nessa! It aims to let
        users select and sort the information they most care about by improving
        discoverability and efficiency. </p>
      <p style="padding-top: 10px">In this design, I made the ability to change
        categories easily discoverable by replacing the dropdown with a row of
        category icons. Users can horizontally scroll to view additional
        categories and this functionality is made apparent by having the rightmost
        icon halfway on the page. When users click an icon, it highlights blue
        to show that the category is active and the respective landmark pins
        populate the map. Additionally, I positioned <i>Filter</i> and <i>Show List</i>
        centered below the row of icons to increase their visibility.</p><br>
      <div class="row">
          <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-5">
            <p><img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./assets/gif/disney-multiple.gif"></p>
            <p style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.2">Users can scroll through
              the row of category icons and select ones they want to view on the
              map by clicking their icon. Multiple categories can be selected.</p><br>
          </div>
          <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-1">
          </div>
          <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-5">
            <p><img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./assets/gif/disney-sort.gif"></p>
            <p style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.2">When "Show List" is
              clicked, a panel slides up with list items arranged alphabetically
              by default. With the "Sort By" menu, users can change how the list
              is sorted.</p><br>
          </div>
      </div>
      <p>When users click <i>Show List</i>, a panel slides up from the bottom of the
        page containing the list. In the original design, the list is ordered
        alphabetically which doesn’t cater to what users care about (e.g. wait
        time and distance). My solution was to add a sort feature that allows
        users to sort the list (i.e. A to Z, Category, Distance, Wait Time).</p>
      <p style="padding-top: 10px">In addition to changing categories, we decided
        to allow users to have multiple categories active at once. This saves
        users time by not having to go back and forth between categories.
        Instead they can look at all the information they need at once! And if
        the map becomes overwhelming with so many pins, they can simply reduce
        the number of active categories.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-container-spacer">
      <h3>user testing</h3>
      <p>The overall goal of our user testing was to answer these two questions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Are the map page's features—filter, category selection, list
          view—easily discoverable?</li>
        <li>How effective are the new features (search in prototype 1 & sort in
          prototype 2)?</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="padding-top: 10px">Due to limited time, we used a between-subjects
        design with 4 new participants. In other words, both prototypes were
        tested by an experienced and novice user. I tested a novice user with
        the prototype I created—prototype 2!</p><br>
      <p><img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./assets/images/Disney/participants-2.png"></p><br>
      <p>Similar to our initial interview, we started with demographic questions
        to understand their background and experience with the app and Disneyland
        overall. Participants were asked to think aloud while they completed 2
        tasks—each one designed to have participants use the map's features beyond
        the default settings. For example, one of our tasks was to find Elsa—can
        you tell we LOVE Elsa—because finding character's was a huge pain point
        in our initial interviews.</p><br>
      <p><img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./assets/images/Disney/map-character-task.png"></p>
      <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 13px">example—this task provided insight on how discoverable <i>Category Selection</i> is</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-container-spacer">
      <h3>user testing results</h3>
      <p><img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./assets/images/Disney/user-testing-results.png"></p><br>
      <p>Our user testing showed that both prototypes made the map page's
        features more discoverable, especially for <i>Category Selection</i>—with
        prototype one's bottom panel and prototype two's scrollable row of icons!
        However we concluded our best option would be to pursue prototype 2 for
        the following reasons:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Experienced users were confused why there were 2 search bars in
          prototype one and wondered how they were different</li>
        <li>Users have to know what they want to search to utilize prototype
          one's search bar, whereas prototype two's sortable list allows
          efficient browsing</li>
        <li>The list's different sorting options let's users sort the list in a
          way that matters to them (e.g. wait time, distance)!</li>
        <li>Selecting multiple categories improves efficiency—don't have to
          switch between categories & can populate map with all categories they
          care about</li>
        <li>Changing categories is easier in prototype two since the row of icons
          are always present, while the ability is hidden in prototype one's
          bottom panel</li>
      </ul>
      <p>After discussing the strengths and weaknesses of our sketches, we further
        developed two features of our sketches that best help users discover the
        map's features—my category icons and sortable list & Tiffany’s pull-up
        panel. As a result, we developed two distinct high fidelity prototypes
        in Figma.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-container-spacer">
      <h3>reflections + lesson learned</h3>
      <p>As a HUGE Disney lover, I was super passionate about this project and
        wanted this redesign to be the best it could! To make our high fidelity
        prototype, I spent so many hours learning Figma so I could make the
        design I pictured in my head, and the sleep deprivation was totally
        worth it! And to my amazing teammates, I learned so much from them and
        couldn't have done it without them—from Nessa's Figma expertise and
        Kristen's Disney connections to Tiffany's aesthetic and thoughtfulness.</p>
      <p style="padding-top: 10px">Most importantly, I learned a lot about
        understanding the viewpoints of different users and seeing how experience
        shapes how one uses the app. For instance, a cast member who uses the app
        daily saw different problems than someone who had never seen the app, which
        we were able to discover because we took the time to carefully select our
        participants and craft our questions and tasks. So my biggest takeaway is
        that good interviews will greatly help you discover important insights!</p><br>
