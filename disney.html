  <!--overview-->
  <div class="casestudy-container" style="background-color: #F8F8F8;">
    <h4>Problem</h4>
    <p>The Disneyland app was released to make park visits even more magical!
      With the app, you can buy tickets, check wait times, locate favorite characters,
      make dining plans, and much more. While these features are useful in theory,
      my team—as park visitors and users of the app—have personally experienced
      confusion and frustration trying to navigate the app. We want to redesign
      the app so Disneyland’s 51,000 daily park visitors have easier and more
      delightful app experiences so they can fully enjoy their time at the happiest
      place on Earth!</p>
  </div>

  <!--research intro-->
  <div class="casestudy-container">
    <h2 style="margin-top: 0px">Research</h2>
    <p>We started by identifying general pain points to further explore during
      our interviews and usability testing. Our teammate Kristen, a cast member
      at Disneyland, reached out on Instagram to gather thoughts on the app from
      her followers:</p>
    <br><br>
    <img src="images/disney/ig-responses.png" width="100%" style="margin-bottom: 64px">
    <p>In addition to collecting these responses, we each performed a deep dive
      into the app to uncover confusing components. Through all these explorations,
      we identified <u>four major pain points</u>:</p>
    <br><br>
    <img src="images/disney/4-pain-points.png" width="100%">
  </div>

  <!--interviews-->
  <div class="casestudy-container" style="background-color: #F8F8F8;">
    <h4>Interviews</h4>
    <p>As Disneyland attracts thousands of visitors every day, there's a wide
      range of expertise when it comes to the app. We wanted to represent this
      diversity in our interview participants, which is why we decided on these
      four main users:</p>
    <br>
    <img src="images/disney/types-of-users.png" width="100%" style="margin-bottom: 40px">
    <p>As we had limited time for this project, each team member interviewed one
      of the four main users. Our chosen participants came from all walks of life,
      aging 20 to 28, but our selection may be limited because we didn't explicitly
      consider tech saviness, which may have influenced one’s app experience. I
      interviewed someone who hadn’t been to the parks since the app was released,
      so I collected insights on how a first time user familiarizes themself with
      the app!</p>
    <br>
    <p>The interview was semi-structured with open-ended questions and a user
      testing portion. We started with demographic questions to learn about their
      background and experience with the app and Disneyland overall. For the user
      testing, participants were asked to think aloud while they completed 4
      tasks—each one highlighting one of the 4 major pain points.</p>
    <br><br>
    <img src="images/disney/planning.png" width="100%">
    <p class="caption" style="margin-bottom: 0px">example—this task provided insight on how people use the app to plan their day in the park</p>
  </div>

  <!--interview results-->
  <div class="casestudy-container">
    <h4>Interview Results</h4>
    <p>After conducting our interviews, we found that users repeatedly struggled
      when tasks involved the map page, particularly discovering the useful features
      behind the map's default settings. Specifically the Filter, Category Selection,
      and Show List features went unnoticed.</p>
    <br>
    <img src="images/disney/map-page-issue.png" width="100%" style="margin-bottom: 40px">
    <p>As a result of missing these features, users found the map's information
      lacking and navigated away to the search page. While they could insert any
      key word, the search feature has its limitations for what information it
      brings up. For example, my interviewee struggled to locate Elsa for one of
      the user testing tasks. On the map page, he didn't notice the dropdown to
      change the category from Attractions to Characters, so he went to the search
      page to type in Elsa. However, character information is only available on
      the map page, so his search failed.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Furthermore, Tiffany pointed out that the map allows users to visualize
      the locations of multiple landmarks, as well as browse a list of ones for
      those who don’t have something specific to search for. For these reasons,
      we see the map's usefulness and potential to have strong impact for users,
      which is why our focus will be to make the map page’s features—filter,
      category selection, list view—more easily discoverable.</p>
  </div>

  <!--competitive analysis-->
  <div class="casestudy-container" style="background-color: #F8F8F8;">
    <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
    <p>We examined how other apps handle their map pages and relevant features,
      especially how easily landmark categories and filters can be accessed. I
      headed the competitive analysis of the Universal Studios app.</p>
    <br>
    <img src="images/disney/competitive-analysis.png" width="100%" style="margin-bottom: 64px">
    <p>After we tried all of their features, I summarized our findings into key
      takeaways that we incorporated during our ideation phase:</p>
    <ul style="font-size: 18px">
      <li><b>Apple Maps'</b> functionalities are clearly labed and easily discoverable!
        It provides flexibility and efficiency by giving users the option to
        either search or browse for their destination.</li>
      <li><b>Universal Studios</b> makes adding and removing categories to the map and
        list view easily accessible and intuitive with the top bar.</li>
      <li><b>Six Flags</b> makes adding and removing categories to the map and list view
        easily accessible and intuitive with the top bar. However it is restrictive
        in regards to accessing detailed information from the map view.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <!--sketches-->
  <div class="casestudy-container">
    <h2 style="margin-top: 0px">Ideation</h2>
    <p>Incorporating our user testing findings and competitive analysis insights,
      each team member sketched their ideal redesign for the map page with a focus
      on discoverability:</p>
    <br><br>
    <img src="images/disney/sketches.png" width="100%" style="margin-bottom: 48px;">
    <p>Here are the main features of our sketches:</p>
    <ul style="font-size:18px">
      <li>Allison—Row of category icons are horizontally scrollable (inspired by
        SixFlags and Instagram). Center Filter and Show List and add their
        respective icons. List view is sortable.</li>
      <li>Nessa—Category icons are laid out in a column. Search function is added
        to the top bar. Add Draw function to select map regions.</li>
      <li>Tiffany—Categories are listed in a pull-up panel. Increase text size
        for Filter and Show List.</li>
      <li>Kristen—Categories are listed in left column. Other important information
        in right column. Users can easily access their frequently used items.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>After discussing the strengths and weaknesses of our sketches, we further
      developed two features of our sketches that best help users discover the
      map's features—my category icons and sortable list & Tiffany’s pull-up panel.
      As a result, we developed two distinct high fidelity prototypes in Figma.</p>
  </div>

  <!--high fidelity prototype 1-->
  <div class="casestudy-container" style="background-color: #F8F8F8;">
    <h2>Prototype 1</h2>
    <p>The first prototype was headed by Tiffany and Nessa. It maintains the simple
      aesthetic and layout of the original design, but adds a bottom pull-up panel
      inspired by Apple Maps to make <span style="background-color: #FFE495">category selection more noticeable</span>.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In this design, the panel slides up when the user first navigates to the
      map page and will only collapse once a category is selected. This is done
      intentionally to make users aware of the available categories, since many
      users didn't know there were options other than Attractions. Additionally,
      the size and weight of the Filter and Show List buttons were increased due
      to our interview participants failing to notice them during testing.</p>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <img src="images/disney/disney-panel.gif" class="phone-gif">
        <p class="gif-caption">The panel slides up when the user first navigates to
          the map page making them aware of the different categories. It will only
          collapse once they select a category.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <img src="images/disney/disney-search.gif" class="phone-gif">
        <p class="gif-caption">Users can slide the panel up to change the category
          or use the panel's search function by clicking the search bar.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>And the most distinct aspect of this prototype was the inclusion of a
      search bar in the pull-up panel. We noticed that some interview participants
      relied heavily on the search function to find characters, look up ride times,
      find restaurants, etc. We opted to make this popular feature more accessible
      but still unobtrusive by placing it in the categories panel. With this feature,
      users who are looking for something specific can quickly obtain the information
      and carry on with their Disneyland trip instead of navigating between the map
      and search page.</p>

  </div>

  <!--high fidelity prototype 2-->
  <div class="casestudy-container">
    <h2 style="margin-top: 0px">Prototype 2</h2>
    <p>Our second prototype was headed by myself and Nessa! It aims to let users
      select and sort the information they most care about by <span style="background-color: #FFE495">
      improving discoverability and efficiency</span>.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In this design, I made the ability to change categories easily discoverable
      by replacing the dropdown with a row of category icons. Users can horizontally
      scroll to view additional categories and this functionality is made apparent
      by having the rightmost icon halfway on the page. When users click an icon,
      it highlights blue to show that the category is active and the respective
      landmark pins populate the map. Additionally, I positioned Filter and Show
      List centered below the row of icons to increase their visibility.</p>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <img src="images/disney/disney-multiple.gif" class="phone-gif">
        <p class="gif-caption">Users can scroll through the row of category icons
          and select ones they want to view on the map by clicking their icon.
          Multiple categories can be selected.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <img src="images/disney/disney-sort.gif" class="phone-gif">
        <p class="gif-caption">When "Show List" is clicked, a panel slides up
          with list items arranged alphabetically by default. With the "Sort By"
          menu, users can change how the list is sorted.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>When users click Show List, a panel slides up from the bottom of the page
      containing the list. In the original design, the list is ordered alphabetically
      which doesn’t cater to what users care about (e.g. wait time and distance).
      My solution was to add a sort feature that allows users to sort the list
      (i.e. A to Z, Category, Distance, Wait Time).</p>
    <br>
    <p>In addition to changing categories, we decided to allow users to have
      multiple categories active at once. This saves users time by not having to
      go back and forth between categories. Instead they can look at all the
      information they need at once! And if the map becomes overwhelming with so
      many pins, they can simply reduce the number of active categories.</p>
  </div>

  <!--user testing-->
  <div class="casestudy-container" style="background-color: #F8F8F8;">
    <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
    <p>The overall goal of our user testing was to answer these two questions:</p>
    <ul style="font-size: 18px">
      <li>Are the map page's features—filter, category selection, list view—easily discoverable?</li>
      <li>How effective are the new features (search in prototype 1 & sort in prototype 2)?</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>Due to limited time, we used a between-subjects design with 4 new participants.
      In other words, both prototypes were tested by an experienced and novice user.
      I tested a novice user with the prototype I created—prototype 2!</p>
    <br>
    <img src="images/disney/participants-2.png" width=100% style="margin-bottom: 40px">
    <p>Similar to our initial interview, we started with demographic questions to
      understand their background and experience with the app and Disneyland overall.
      Participants were asked to think aloud while they completed 2 tasks—each one
      designed to have participants use the map's features beyond the default settings.
      For example, one of our tasks was to find Elsa—can you tell we LOVE Elsa—because
      finding character's was a huge pain point in our initial interviews.</p>
    <br><br>
    <img src="images/disney/map-character-task.png" width=100%>
    <p class="caption" style="margin-bottom: 0px">example—this task provided insight on how discoverable Category Selection is</p>
  </div>

  <!--user testing results-->
  <div class="casestudy-container">
    <h2>User Testing Results</h2><br>
    <img src="images/disney/user-testing-results.png" width="100%" style="margin-bottom: 48px;">
    <p>Our user testing showed that both prototypes made the map page's features
      more discoverable, especially for Category Selection—with prototype one's
      bottom panel and prototype two's scrollable row of icons! However we
      concluded our best option would be to pursue prototype 2 for the following
      reasons:</p>
    <ul style="font-size: 18px">
      <li>Experienced users were confused why there were 2 search bars in
        prototype one and wondered how they were different</li>
      <li>Users have to know what they want to search to utilize prototype one's
        search bar, whereas prototype two's sortable list allows efficient browsing</li>
      <li>The list's different sorting options let's users sort the list in a way
        that matters to them (e.g. wait time, distance)!</li>
      <li>Selecting multiple categories improves efficiency—don't have to switch
        between categories & can populate map with all categories they care about</li>
      <li>Changing categories is easier in prototype two since the row of icons
        are always present, while the ability is hidden in prototype one's bottom panel</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>After discussing the strengths and weaknesses of our sketches, we further
      developed two features of our sketches that best help users discover the
      map's features—my category icons and sortable list & Tiffany’s pull-up panel.
      As a result, we developed two distinct high fidelity prototypes in Figma.</p>
  </div>

  <!--reflections-->
  <div class="casestudy-container" style="background-color: #F8F8F8;">
    <h2 style="margin-top: 0px">Reflection</h2>
    <p>As a HUGE Disney lover, I was super passionate about this project and
      wanted this redesign to be the best it could! To make our high fidelity
      prototype, I spent so many hours learning Figma so I could make the design
      I pictured in my head, and the sleep deprivation was totally worth it! And
      to my amazing teammates, I learned so much from them and couldn't have done
      it without them—from Nessa's Figma expertise and Kristen's Disney connections
      to Tiffany's aesthetic and thoughtfulness.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Most importantly, I learned a lot about understanding the viewpoints of
      different users and seeing how experience shapes how one uses the app. For
      instance, a cast member who uses the app daily saw different problems than
      someone who had never seen the app, which we were able to discover because
      we took the time to carefully select our participants and craft our questions
      and tasks. So my biggest takeaway is that good interviews will greatly help
      you discover important insights!</p>
