  <!--overview-->
  <div class="casestudy-container" style="background-color: #F8F8F8;">
    <p>Abound is an online two-sided marketplace for buying and selling wholesale. A
       big incentive for retailers to order through Abound was our “free shipping on orders
      over $500” offer.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Problem</h4>
    <p>Our free shipping offer greatly helped retailers by lowering their expenses,
      however this incentive was a major cost for Abound. With the goal of
      improving unit economics and activating alternate revenue streams, the
      product team was tasked with replacing the current offer with a subscription
      that retailers could pay for to get free shipping.</p>
  </div>

  <!--research & ideation-->
  <div class="casestudy-container">
    <h2 style="margin-top: 0px">Research & Ideation</h2>
    <h4>Market Research</h4>
    <p>To get a sense of the landscape, I looked at direct competitors (Faire &
      Tundra) and other companies (Amazon) that offer subscriptions for free shipping.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <img src="images/premium/comp-analysis.svg" width="100%" style="margin-bottom: 64px">
    <div class="row" style="margin-bottom: 16px">
      <div class="col-sm-2"><h6>Insight 1</h6></div>
      <div class="col-sm-10">
        <h6>Cost: membership fee vs. retailer spend</h6>
        <p>Faire and Amazon’s monthly membership fee is simpler and more intuitive
          for subscribers. Retailers don’t have to worry about spending a certain
          amount each month to maintain their subscription. Plus paying a monthly
          fee less than $20 feels way less overwhelming than spending $500 each
          month, especially for smaller retailers.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row" style="margin-bottom: 16px">
      <div class="col-sm-2"><h6>Insight 2</h6></div>
      <div class="col-sm-10">
        <h6>Restrictions on retailer eligibility to mitigate risk</h6>
        <p>Our direct competitors have limitations on which retailers get access
          to the subscription so that they know they're covering
          costs for "good acting" retailers.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row" style="margin-bottom: 16px">
      <div class="col-sm-2"><h6>Insight 3</h6></div>
      <div class="col-sm-10">
        <h6>Limitations to the free shipping offer</h6>
        <p>All the subscriptions either limit free shipping to select brands
          or for orders over a certain amount. Free shipping for all brands/orders
          could be an opportunity for us to really differentiate ourselves!</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row" style="margin-bottom: 16px">
      <div class="col-sm-2"><h6>Insight 4</h6></div>
      <div class="col-sm-10">
        <h6>Offering additional incentives</h6>
        <p>Our competitors have other benefits for their subscribers like early
          access and priority support. I kept this in mind moving foward as I
          want our subscription to be competitive.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row" style="margin-bottom: 16px">
      <div class="col-sm-2"><h6>Insight 5</h6></div>
      <div class="col-sm-10">
        <h6>Lots of opportunity</h6>
        <p>Excluding Faire & Tundra, the majority of online wholesale marketplaces
          (Ankorstore, Handshake, Bulletin, Mable, etc.) do not offer subscriptions
          for free shipping! I saw this as a positive as our subscription wouldn’t
          be entering too saturated of a space.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!--mini design sprint-->
  <div class="casestudy-container" style="background-color: #F8F8F8;">
    <h4>Mini Design Sprint</h4>
    <p>I did a mini design sprint with key stakeholders. We discussed the insights
      from the market research before doing a round of crazy 8s, then dot voted
      on the ideas we found the most promising/interesting.</p>
    <br>
    <img src="images/premium/crazy8.png" width="100%" style="margin-bottom: 64px">
    <p>Ideas/patterns that emerged:</p>
    <img src="images/premium/sprint-patterns.jpg" width="100%" style="margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 64px">
    <p>After our mini design sprint, I had a pretty good idea of what we should
      do for pricing & retailer eligibility based on the ideas/patterns I saw:</p>
    <ul style="font-size: 18px">
      <li><b><span style="background-color: #FFE495">Pricing</span>:</b> Offer a monthly and yearly subscription</li>
        <ul><li>Have the yearly plan slightly discounted to encourage more people
          to choose it & lock them into the subscription</li></ul>
      <li style="margin-top: 10px"><b><span style="background-color: #FFE495">Retailer
        eligibility</span>:</b> Available to all retailers (no restrictions)</li>
        <ul><li>Why? 1) our current incentive is available to all, 2) the more retailers
          that sign up for the subscription the better because it leads to more orders,
          and 3) Abound will be covering all the shipping costs instead of splitting
          them with the brands, so we don't need to reassure brands that subscribers
          are "good acting" retailers</li></ul>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <!--exploration: subscription benefits-->
  <div class="casestudy-container">
    <h4>Exploration: Subscription Benefits</h4>
    <p>Now it was time to pinpoint what the exact benefits of the subscription
      would be! To help guide this process, I took a look at the pros and cons
      for the two main questions we needed to answer regarding the subscription
      benefits:</p>
    <br>
    <h6>Question 1: Free shipping for select brands or all brands?</h6>
    <br>
    <img src="images/premium/select-vs-all.svg" width="100%" style="margin-bottom: 40px">
    <h6>Decision: Free shipping for all brands</h6>
    <p>The biggest motivator towards selecting this option was that it's a
      significantly better offer than our competitors' and helps us differentiate.
      Plus this option has less risk of upsetting brands and retailers!</p>
    <br>
    <hr class="solid">
    <br>
    <h6>Question 2: What benefits do we want to offer in addition to free shipping?</h6>
    <img src="images/premium/benefits.jpg" width="100%" style="margin-bottom: 40px">
    <h6>Decision: Priority support</h6>
    <p>We’ve learned through feedback & interviews that our customer support team
      is a big factor in why retailers choose us over our competitors, so we want
      to leverage this strength that our cx team brings as another benefit for
      subscribers.</p>
  </div>

  <!--sketches & wireframes-->
  <div class="casestudy-container" style="background-color: #F8F8F8;">
    <h4>Sketches & Wireframes</h4>
    <p>Now that we had our subscription program defined, it was time to start
      designing the different touchpoints: landing page, onboarding, shopping bag,
      etc. I started with some sketches then created wireframes in Figma. I
      specifically started wireframing for mobile since the majority of our
      retailers shop Abound on their phone.</p>
    <br>
    <img src="images/premium/sketches.png" width="100%" style="margin-bottom: 32px">
    <img src="images/premium/wireframes.png" width="100%">
  </div>

  <!--user testing-->
  <div class="casestudy-container">
    <h2 style="margin-top: 0px">User Testing</h2>
    <p>Over Zoom, I user tested a Figma prototype I created with 9 retailers
      ranging from newer to very experienced. Instead of just walking them through
      the Premium landing page and asking for their feedback on the subscription,
      I asked them to do various tasks with a prototype that included
      our subscription touchpoints.</p><br>
    <p>By structuring these interviews this way I hoped to learn 1) if these
      touchpoints had enough visibility and 2) if they noticed the touchpoints,
      were they interested in the subscription’s benefits.</p>
    <br>
    <img src="images/premium/prototype-screenshot.png" width="100%">
    <p class="caption" style="margin-bottom: 0px">Prototyping in Figma -- so many connections 😅</p>
  </div>

  <!--sketches & wireframes-->
  <div class="casestudy-container" style="background-color: #F8F8F8;">
    <p>In an ideal world, I’d be able to run in-person tests using a figma
      prototype on my phone... but since we were doing these over Zoom, I used a
      Desktop prototype for the tasks! These were a few of the screens that
      included the Premium subscription touchpoints:</p>

        <p class="caption"><b style="font-weight: 600">Landing page</b>: Info about the Premium subscription</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!--interview findings-->
  <div class="casestudy-container">
    <h4 style="margin-top: 0px">Interview Findings</h4>
    <p>I compiled all my findings from the interviews into a google sheet to help
      me identify patterns and key insights:</p>
    <br>
    <img src="images/premium/google-sheet.png" width="100%" style="margin-bottom: 40px">
    <h6>7/9 pointed out the Premium subscription during a task</h6>
    <p><span style="background-color: #DFE8CB">Validates touchpoints</span></p>
    <p>This showed me that the touchpoints we’re planning to add across the site
      are attention grabbing and give good visibility to the subscription</p>
    <br>
    <h6>9/9 are interested in unlimited free shipping</h6>
    <p><span style="background-color: #DFE8CB">Validates free shipping as a benefit</span></p>
    <p>It was repeatedly brought up how expensive shipping is getting these days,
      so anything that will help lower their costs is enticing! Plus a few retailers
      mentioned how they wouldn’t have to wait to place one big order over $500
      anymore. Instead they’d be able to place orders more frequently, which is
      great for us since they’d be on the site more!</p>
    <br>
    <h6>5/9 would sign up for the subscription</h6>
    <p><span style="background-color: #ECECEC">Unclear if retailers will use</span></p>
    <p>This stat is a decent signal that people would subscribe, but what people say
      they’ll do doesn't always align with what they’ll actually do. Some retailers said
      they’d sign up right away without hesitation, but most said they’d need to
      look at their expenses to see if it’s worth it for them, especially since a
      few of them already use a competitor's subscription.</p>
    <br>
    <h6>4/9 are interested in priority support</h6>
    <p><span style="background-color: #F7D5DB">Doesn't validate priority support as a benefit</span></p>
    <p>Most retailers talked about how their experience with our customer support
      team is already super great and fast, so they wouldn’t be interested in
      paying for this benefit</p>
    <br>
    <h6>7/9 use our current free shipping incentive</h6>
    <p><span style="background-color: #ECECEC">Unclear how removing the current offer will be received</span></p>
    <p>Going into this project, we knew that our current offer was a really good
      incentive to place an order on Abound, but we didn’t know how much of an
      impact it had. Almost all the retailers I talked to were consistently taking
      advantage of this offer. This led to a few questions:</p>
    <ul style="font-size: 18px">
      <li>How much of our GMV is coming from orders over $500 (thus using the offer)?</li>
      <li>Will we lose retailers if we outright replace the current offer with the subscription?</li>
    </ul>

  </div>

  <!--key takeaways & iterations-->
  <div class="casestudy-container" style="background-color: #F8F8F8;">
    <h4 style="margin-bottom: 24px">Iterations</h4>
    <h6>Removing priority support as a benefit</h6>
    <p>While not desireable to established retailers since they know our support
      team is already quick & efficient, I considered keeping priority support as
      part of the subscription thinking new retailers might find it enticing since
      they haven't interacted with our support team yet.</p>

    <p>However my manager brought up the Presenter’s
      Paradox, which shows that when offers are bundled, people perceive the value
      as an average rather than a sum. In our case, since retailers aren’t
      perceiving priority support as valuable, this paradox suggests including
      it would lead to less sign ups than if we removed it.</p>
    <br>
    <h6>Need to work closely with product marketing on the subscriptions rollout</h6>
    <p>After so many retailers mentioned their consistent use of the current free
      shipping incentive, we looked into some data on how this offer is being
      used—about 18-20% of all our daily orders are over $500. This is a big
      chunk of our GMV indicating we need to be really thoughtful about how we
      launch the subscription and remove the current offer.</p>
  </div>

  <!--final design-->
  <div class="casestudy-container">
    <h2 style="margin-top: 0px">Final Design</h2>
    <p>After multiple iterations of ui and copy changes, I finalized desktop and
      mobile designs then added annotations for the engineering team:</p>
    <br>
    <img src="images/premium/final.png" width="100%" style="margin-bottom: 64px">
    <br>
    <h4>Premium Landing Page</h4>
    <ul style="font-size: 18px">
      <li>Updated the main headline to focus on unlimited free shipping because
        it's attention grabbing and more clear than generally saying they'll "save money"</li>
      <li>Added the monthly & yearly plans onto this page instead of hiding it
        on the sign up page, since it's useful for deciding if you want to subscribe or not</li>
      <li>Since we're only offering free shipping with this subscription, I updated
        the "Why go Premium?" to a "How it works" section, which explains how it's
        super easy to sign up, save money, and change your subscription anytime</li>
    </ul>

    </div>
    <br><br>
    <h4>Premium Touchpoints</h4>
    <p>I added touchpoints for the subscription in the navbar to give it visibility
      since the navbar shows on every page. I also included callouts in the order
      index and shopping bag, since retailers are likely thinking about how much
      they're spending when they visit those pages:</p>
    <br>
    <center><img src="images/premium/touchpoints.gif" width="100%" style="margin-bottom: 64px; max-width:700px; box-shadow: 0px 5px 30px 0px rgba(0,0,0,0.25);"></center>
    <br>
    <h4>Managing Your Subscription</h4>
    <p>Premium subscribers will be able to view how much they've saved on free shipping, access their subscription invoices, and change/pause/cancel their subscription at any time.</p>
    <br>
    <center><img src="images/premium/manage.gif" width="100%" style="margin-bottom: 64px; max-width:700px; box-shadow: 0px 5px 30px 0px rgba(0,0,0,0.25);"></center>
  </div>

  <!--results-->
  <div class="casestudy-container" style="background-color: #F8F8F8;">
    <h2>Learnings</h2>
    <p>As of today the retailer subscription is fully developed but its release
      is on hold. After I flagged the potential risk of removing the
      current offer from what I learned during user testing, our stakeholders, finance,
      and product marketing teams worked on creating a rollout plan that would
      avoid upsetting current retailers, but ultimately deemed it too risky to release
      with the stage our company was in.</p>
    <p>Working at a startup, I've learned that sometimes that's just how things go!
       But even though I never got to see this feature launch, I'm very happy with
      the subscription I put together with my team.</p>
