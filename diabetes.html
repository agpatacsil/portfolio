      <p class="case-info">—Empowering Dexcom users to manage diabetes through design</p>
      <br><br><br>

      <p>This past fall, I was a research assistant in the UCSD Design Lab as
        part of their Diabetes Design Initiative team. We partnered with medical
        device manufacturer Dexcom for a 7-week design sprint to address issues
        with the company’s continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system’s mobile interface.
        Throughout this project, I worked on a smaller team with four other
        student designers. We conducted user research to identify the most
        pressing issues that Dexcom’s users were facing. The insights we found
        led us to focus on designing a solution that empowered users to
        efficiently manage their diabetes.
      </p><br>
      <center><img src="images/diabetes/team.png" width=80%></center><br>
      <p>This was a very iterative and collaborative design process. Each week,
        we were able to discuss our ideas with Dexcom’s users and company
        representatives to make sure we were tackling relevant problems with
        feasible solutions. At one point, my group actually had to completely
        change the direction of our project. Our design was innovative and
        received positive feedback from users, but due to circumstances
        regarding policies, we couldn’t move forward with it. This put our group
        behind schedule, but we chose not to view it as a setback! We just viewed
        it as another step in the design process and a way to improve our
        versatility as designers.

      <p>Note: The specifics of my work is under NDA, but feel free to reach out and I
        can discuss more about the work I did!
