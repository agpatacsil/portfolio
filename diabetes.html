      <b>Disclaimer‚ÄîAs I had to sign a NDA, there's only so much I can share
        about my experience. If you want to dive into more details, feel free to
        contact me!</b><br><br>


      <p class="header" style="margin-top: 40px">BACKGROUND</p>
      <p>This past fall, I was a research assistant in the UCSD Design Lab as part
        of their <b><a href="http://ddi.ucsd.edu/ddi2019.html">Diabetes Design Initiative</a></b>
        team. We partnered with medical device manufacturer <b><a href="https://www.dexcom.com/">Dexcom</a></b>
        for a 7-week design sprint to address common issues with their continuous
        glucose monitor (CGM) and the mobile app that connects to it. My sub-team
        started by focusing on how to help users understand the accuracy of their
        CGM readings, but shifted our focus to empowering users to independently troubleshoot.</p>
      <br><br>
        <img src="images/diabetes/ddi-timeline.png" width=100%><br><br>


      <p class="header" style="margin-top: 40px">EMPATHIZING</p>
      <p>We researched issues surrounding the accuracy of CGM readings by reading
        through transcripts of old Dexcom user interviews, as well as looking at
        comments and reviews posted in Facebook groups, Reddit, and other online sites.
        Then we took what we learned and created a storyboard to visually define
        and demonstrate the main issue we had found‚Äîusers being unsure of the accuracy
        of their CGM readings.
      </p>

      <div class="row" style="margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px">
        <div class="col-sm-6">
          <img src="images/diabetes/storyboard.png" width=100% style="padding: 20px">
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-6">
          <img src="images/diabetes/ideation.png" width=100% style="padding: 20px">
        </div>
      </div>
      <br>
      <p>After defining the problem, we looked at current solutions and brainstormed
         new ideas. We identified the user's main need to be a feature that helps
         them understand their CGM readings when they feel unsure about it. We
         proposed a tool that checks people's symptoms and offers steps for how to
         proceed.
      </p>

     <p class="header" style="margin-top: 40px">BEING ADAPTABLE</p>
     <p>Before we began designing, we presented our findings and idea to the Dexcom team.
        While our solution was innovative, some concerns (regarding policies) were brought up about our idea,
        and we were asked to pivot our focus to helping users troubleshoot
        independently. And while we would've liked to pursue our original idea,
        it was important to understand and follow the needs of Dexcom! </p><p>So after
        another round of research and ideation, we found lack of information
        regarding session activity as a catalyst for uncertainty and inability to
        troubleshoot. Therefore we proposed providing users with previous and current
        session information in a "help" page, which they can use to self-troubleshoot.

      </p>

      <p class="header" style="margin-top: 40px">PROTOTYPING</p>
      <p>We continued by each creating rough sketches of our ideal design, then
         incorporating the best ideas from our individual sketches into one
         paper prototype. With this prototype we did a short round of user testing
         with Dexcom users and incorporated their feedback and insights into our
         high-fidelity prototype created in Figma. With this visual prototype, we did
         another round of user testing where we got insight on how to proceed with
         how to layout session information in a more intuitive and meaningful way.
      </p>


      <p class="header" style="margin-top: 40px">USER TESTING</p>
      <p>Moving forward, we developed a coded prototype made with HTML, CSS and
         JavaScript that we used for our final round of user testing. We tested
        our prototype with 8 stakeholders‚Äîranging from people with diabetes varying
         in age to delegates from Dexcom. We created and used a testing script to
         maximize consistency and minimize bias. Overall, we received positive
         feedback and received a 71.25 on the system usability scale.
      </p><br>
      <center><img src="images/diabetes/testing.png" width=80%></center><br>
      <br>
      <p>From our testing, we found that users liked having session information
         in a time based heirarchical order as well as having a filtering system
         to look for information efficiently. And areas we could improve on were
         wording and displaying too much/too little information on the pages.</p>

     <p class="header" style="margin-top: 40px">PRESENTING</p>
     <p>We took the major insights from our user testing to improve our coded
        prototype. Once we had our final deliverable, we created a pitch slide
        and poster to present our findings to Dexcom. Although I cannot disclose
        the final design (wireframes, prototypes, and interactions) due to NDA,
        I am extremely proud of what my team was able to accomplish in these 7 weeks.
