      <p class="header">Problem</p>
      <p>A child's mental health is critical to their growth and ability to
        reach their full potential! Many factors can positively and negatively
        impact a child's mental health & recording those factors and learning
        from them is a great way to strengthen their mental health.
      </p><br>
      <img src="images/not-kid-friendly.png" class="research-pic">
      <br>
      <p>There are many apps focused on mental well-being! They generally contain
         multiple choice and open ended questions that require thoughtful answers,
         as well as different mindfulness exercises. While these apps are great
         for adults who have a greater understanding of mental health, these apps
         aren't kid-friendly!
      </p>
      <!--<p>There are many apps designed to track your mental well-being on a
         daily basis. Generally these apps contain a set of multiple choice and
         open ended questions to respond to. These apps are great for adults
         who are self motivated to answer prompts daily and thoughtfully, but
         not a great option for kids!

      <p class="header">Research</p>
      <p class="subheader">Storyboards</p>
      <p>To start off our research, we constructed storyboards to target the main
         goal of our app. We want to focus on creating a better experience for
         kids who are currently seeing a therapist, so we have 2 scenarios to help
         structure our app functionalities.
      </p><br>

      <img src="images/coco-sb-1.png" class="research-pic">
      <p class="img-caption">storyboard of improving unproductive therapy sessions</p><br>
      <p>It's hard for a lot of kids to open up, especially to someone like a
        therapist, and maybe they just don't know what to share or forget about
        things that happened to them, which leads to hours of unhelpful therapy
        sessions. Our idea is to create a kid-friendly mental health tracker so
        that there will be records of their days that the therapist will have
        access to. The therapist can look over the child's entries and be able to
        structure the session with this information.
      </p><br>

      <img src="images/coco-sb-2.jpg" class="research-pic">
      <p class="img-caption">storyboard of making mental health tracking more fun</p><br>
      <p>This storyboard illustrates how the web-app will get kids excited to
         talk about their feelings.

         Now knowing that we want to create a mental health tracker, we discuss
         how to overcome some obstacles of daily journaling.

         Our second storyboard further explores how we will make the mental health
         tracker kid-friendly. To combat answering boring questions, we want to
         make our app interactive by giving the kids a virtual pet to take care of
         by answering the questions daily.
       </p><br>

      <p class="subheader">Analyzing Competitor Apps</p>
      <p>Now that we had our idea, we wanted to explore mental health trackers
         designed specifically for kids available on Apple's App Store. While
         we found many mental health trackers for adults, only one app resulted
         in our 'mental health tracker kids' search, and it wasn't even a mental
         health tracker!
      </p>
      <br>

        </div>
      </div>

      <p>By widening our search to 'mental health kids', we were able to find two
         strong mental health apps designed for kids, <b>Feelu</b> and <b>Manatee & Me</b>.
       </p>
       <br>

       <div class="row">
         <div class="col-sm-3" style="margin-bottom: 10px">

             <li>Game where the child expresses how they feel in response to

       <div class="row">
         <div class="col-sm-3" style="margin-bottom: 10px">
           <center><img  src="images/manatee-logo.png" style="max-width: 150px"></center><br>

           </ul>
         </div>
       </div>

       <p>These particular apps are great for strenthening kids' mental health
          through exercises, but lack the feature of regularly tracking the
          kids' mental health, which is what we wanted to focus on and confirms
          a need for our app. By having a log of their mental health, therapists
          have the ability to better understand and help their kids.
       </p><br>



      <p class="header">Wireframes</p>
      <p>Here are a few of the wireframes we drew out before we started coding
         our prototype! We have two main user flows--one for the child and one
         for the therapist.
      </p>

      <p class="subheader">Child's Experience</p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-4" style="margin-bottom: 10px">
          <img class="coco-prototype" src="images/coco-prototype/kid - home.png"><br>
          <p class="img-caption">Home Screen</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4" style="margin-bottom: 10px">
          <img class="coco-prototype" src="images/coco-prototype/kid - sleep.png"><br>
          <p class="img-caption">Sleep Habit Questions</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4" style="margin-bottom: 10px">
          <img class="coco-prototype" src="images/coco-prototype/kid - food.png"><br>
          <p class="img-caption">Eating Habit Questions</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>Our user flow starts with the child being greeted by a virtual pet
        (in this wireframe we've chosen a Corgi named Ollie). There are five
        icons below Ollie that lead the child to one of the five questionnaires
        about sleep, school, family, food, and health. Beside each icon is a bar
        that indicates Ollie's level in that category--the bar fills up when
        the kid answers the category's questions and goes down at the start of
        each day.
      </p>


      <p class="subheader">Therapist's Experience</p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-4" style="margin-bottom: 10px">
          <img class="coco-prototype" src="images/coco-prototype/doctor - client list.png"><br>
          <p class="img-caption">List of clients</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4" style="margin-bottom: 10px">

          <p class="img-caption">Summary of client's sleep results</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>Our idea for the therapist is that they will have multiple clients that
         they need to monitor. In our app, the therapist can access their list of
         clients and check up on certain client's profiles and questionnaire
         responses. In addition, we want to make the child's responses easier to
         read and see trends by visualizing the data with line graphs and bar
         charts.
      </p><br>


      <p class="header">User Testing</p>
      <p>For our user testing, we created a Figma prototype using the ideas from
         our paper wireframes. Here are a few of the screens and the feedback
         we received about them! Try our
         <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/Qf0paFr77M7hYlPLNLIMWf/Coco?node-id=3%3A5&scaling=scale-down" target="_blank">
         Figma Prototype!</a>
      </p><br>


      <img class="coco-prototype" src="images/patient-profile.png"><br>
      <p class="subheader" style="color: #b7b7b7">"I wouldn't want my child to
        select <i>Patient</i> everytime they login" --User
      </p>
      <p>A couple of our testers pointed out that they wouldn't want their child
         to login as a patient everytime because it would affect how they view
         themselves. We want the kids using the app to view it positively!
      </p>
      <p>
         <b style="color: #86B3D1">WHAT TO CHANGE.</b> Remove the part where they
         must select whether they're a patient or a therapist. When they login with
         their username and password, we'll have an account type associated with
         it so that they are directed to the home page!
      </p><br>
      <p class="subheader" style="color: #b7b7b7">"I think kids would want more
         interaction with Coco!" --User
      </p>
      <p>Our idea was to only have Coco be a gif on the home page but testers
         noted that children would want to see Coco more so that they feel like
         they're taking care of him!
      </p>
      <p>
         <b style="color: #86B3D1">WHAT TO CHANGE.</b> Instead of <i>telling</i>
          them that Coco gets fed after each survey is completed, we're going to
          <i>show</i> them that Coco gets fed!
      </p><br>

      <img class="coco-prototype" src="images/check-evals.png"><br>
      <p class="subheader" style="color: #b7b7b7">"I have to click through a lot
         of screens to get to the client's survey results!" --User
      </p>
      <p>What we heard from almost everyone who tested our app was that the
         client's survey results are too deep within the app! Once you're on the
         client list page, it requires 3 clicks to get to the survey results!
      </p>
      <p>
         <b style="color: #86B3D1">WHAT TO CHANGE.</b> Make the user flow easier
         by combining the client's profile and status screens! Our users pointed
         out that both screens hold information about the client so having all
         that information on one screen will make it easier to access!
      </p><br>
      <br>

      <img class="coco-prototype2" src="images/taj-firebase2.png" width=250px> -->
      <p>After user testing we coded our prototype using HTML/CSS/JavaScript and
         connected it to a Firebase database to store data such as usernames,
         survey responses, patient information, and assigned surveys. Here are a
         few gifs showing the main functionalities of our app.
      </p>

        </div>
      </div>

      <p><b>Logging In</b><br>When the child logs in for the day, they are
        personally greeted and are asked to feed a sad and hungry Coco! When they
        click the 'Feed Coco!' button, they are brought to their first survey.
      </p>

      <p><b>The Survey</b><br>
        Each survey is composed of kid friendly "I" statements so that they
        focus on their own feelings and beliefs when reading through them.
        A Likert scale is used to measure how strongly they agree or disagree
        with each statement.
      </p>

      <p><b>Feeding Coco</b><br>
        We took our user testing into account and made the
        survey more interactive by inserting an animation of Coco being fed fish
        after each survey is completed!
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Coco is full</b><br>
        Once all assigned surveys are completed, they are brought back to the
        home screen where they see a happy and full Coco, and their work for the
        day is done! If they decide to log in again later in the day, they will
        see a full Coco and are told to come back tomorrow because the surveys
        are to be completed once a day.
      </p>

        When the therapist logs in, they are personally greeted and have the
        option to look at their list of clients or recommend a doctor. Note that
        the 'recommend a doctor' feature is something we decided to add on
      </p>

      <p><b>Feeding Coco</b><br>
        As mentioned earlier, we took our user testing into account and made the
        survey more interactive by inserting an animation of Coco being fed fish
        after each survey is completed!
      </p>

        <b>Coco is full</b><br>
        Once all assigned surveys are completed, they are brought back to the
        home screen where they see a happy and full Coco, and their work for the
