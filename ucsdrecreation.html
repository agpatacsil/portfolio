      <p class="title">Overview</p>
      <p>For our project, we took a look at the UCSD Recreation website and observed
         how people navigated through the site pages to sign up for a "Moonlight Kayak"
         trip.  During our interviews, we saw our interviewees primarily making
         mistakes as opposed to slips, which signified to us that this website in its
         current form (as of Winter 2018) is not the best designed.  In our redesign, we
         attempt to minimize these errors based on our findings.</p>

      <p class="title">Interviews</p>

      <p><b>Location:</b> Geisel Library
         <u>because</u> we wanted to see how different types of students interact
          with the website.  At the library we believed we would find a range
          of students, starting from those who rarely take a UCSD recreation class
          to those that frequently take them.  This is in opposition to interviewing
          at RIMAC gym where the majority are more likely to frequent the UCSD
          Recreation website.</p>

      <div class="well" style="background-color: #ffeb7f;">
        <div style="text-align:center;">
          <p><b>Task:</b> Add a "Moonlight Kayak" trip to the shopping cart.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p><b>Recording Method:</b> we collected the interviewees interaction with the
         website by recording our laptop screens, while having someone note slips and
         mistakes in a notebook as well.  This made it easier to provide evidence of the
         slips and mistakes that students made.</p>

      <b>Post Interview Questions</b>
      <div class="panel-group" id="accordion">
        <div class="panel panel-default">

          <div id="collapse1" class="panel-collapse collapse in">
            <div class="panel-body" style="font-size: 15px;">We asked this questions because we knew people
             who frequent the website are less likely to make mistakes and more likely
             to make slips because they have more knowledge of the page navigation.
             It's also important to consider their last time on the webiste (if applicable)
             because it gives us insight into what people typically look for on the website
             and previous experience helps us better understand people's feelings toward
             the website.</div>

          <div id="collapse2" class="panel-collapse collapse">
            <div class="panel-body" style="font-size: 15px;">We asked this question to gain a clear understanding
             as to how the interviewee felt while navigating through the site because
             what we observed might be different from the emotions they felt and
             thoughts that came to their mind.</div>

              Is there anything you would improve/change about this website?</a>
            </h4>

          <div id="collapse3" class="panel-collapse collapse">
            <div class="panel-body" style="font-size: 15px;">We used this question to further understand
             the errors that the interviewee went through by prompting them with how
             they would change it.  We believed that by asking for suggestions, the
             interviewees would likely explain their frustrations with errors in
             greater detail to help them explain how they would improve the website.</div>

      <b>Additional Notes</b>
      <ul>
        <li style="font-size: 17px;">Shortest completion of task was 1 min 24 sec (interviewee #5)
        <li style="font-size: 17px;">Longest completion of task was 8 min 59 sec (interviewee #6)
        <li style="font-size: 17px;">Most of our interviewees had never been on the website before
        <li style="font-size: 17px;">Most of those who finished quickly had been on the website before.  They
            noted that it was confusing the first time, but once they learned how
            to correctly navigate it was easy
        <li style="font-size: 17px;">Wanted more descriptions of the activities
        <li style="font-size: 17px;">Liked the pictures that went with the activities and wanted more
