      <p class="title">Overview</p>
      <p>For our project, we took a look at the UCSD Recreation website and observed
         how people navigated through the site pages to sign up for a "Moonlight Kayak"
         trip.  During our interviews, we saw our interviewees primarily making
         mistakes as opposed to slips, which signified to us that this website in its
         current form (as of Winter 2018) is not the best designed.  In our redesign, we
         attempt to minimize these errors based on our findings.</p>

      <p class="title">Interviews</p>

      <p><b>Location:</b> Geisel Library
         <u>because</u> we wanted to see how different types of students interact
          with the website.  At the library we believed we would find a range
          of students, starting from those who rarely take a UCSD recreation class
          to those that frequently take them.  This is in opposition to interviewing
          at RIMAC gym where the majority are more likely to frequent the UCSD
          Recreation website.</p>

      <p><b>Task:</b> Add a "Moonlight Kayak" trip to the shopping cart.</p>

      <p><b>Recording Method:</b> we collected the interviewees interaction with the
         website by recording our laptop screens, while having someone note slips and
         mistakes in a notebook as well.  This made it easier to provide evidence of the
         slips and mistakes that students made.</p>

            <div class="panel-body" style="font-size: 15px;">We asked this questions because we knew people
             who frequent the website are less likely to make mistakes and more likely
             to make slips because they have more knowledge of the page navigation.
             It's also important to consider their last time on the webiste (if applicable)
             because it gives us insight into what people typically look for on the website
             and previous experience helps us better understand people's feelings toward
             the website.</div>

            <div class="panel-body" style="font-size: 15px;">We asked this question to gain a clear understanding
             as to how the interviewee felt while navigating through the site because
             what we observed might be different from the emotions they felt and
             thoughts that came to their mind.</div>

          <div id="collapse3" class="panel-collapse collapse">
            <div class="panel-body" style="font-size: 15px;">We used this question to further understand
             the errors that the interviewee went through by prompting them with how
             they would change it.  We believed that by asking for suggestions, the
             interviewees would likely explain their frustrations with errors in
             greater detail to help them explain how they would improve the website.</div>

          <p><br></p>
          <p>To login, 76% of students incorrectly insterted
          their username and password in the indicated fields.
          They failed to notice that they were trying to login as a
          community member.  This is a <b><u>knowledge-based mistake</u></b> because they
          didn't know that they needed to click the blue box to login and kept trying to
          login through the community member login.  The blue box, and the written statements
          in the blue rectanges are not good enough <b><u>signifiers</u></b> for users to notice it so they
          lacked an important piece of information to successfully login as a UCSD student.
          Interviewees noted how the blue box is a bad <b><u>signifier</u></b> because it blends in with
          the page--looking more like a title header then a clickable login link.</p>

          <p><br></p>
          <p>Interviewees who had scrolled to the bottom of the page before using the search
          bar had this screen.  When the search results were loaded, the page does
          not automatically scroll back up, so the interviewees were viewing the middle
          to the bottom of the page.  Users thought search results weren't showing, however
          they were at the top of the page.  This is a <b><u>knowledge-based mistake</u></b>
          because users didn't know what to do.  They were missing the <b><u>conceptual model</u></b>
          that they needed to scroll back up to the top of the page, which is why they were
          unable to see search results, if any.</p>

          <p>12% encountered the recreation events selection at the bottom of the
             website.  When they chose to click the recreation events box, it
             navigated them to the UCSD Recreation Facebook page.  This is a
             <b><u>knowledge-based mistake</u></b> because the student believed
             that clicking on it would navigated them to a page full of recreation
             events, but it did not.  The outlined recreation events section has the
             Facebook logo, which is supposed to <b><u>signify</u></b> that you will
             navigate to the Facebook page.  The students' <b><u>mental model</u></b>
             didn't match the <b><u>conceptual model</u></b> of the designer.  This
             is due to how the Recreation Events box is <b><u>poorly signified</u></b>
             due to the fact that the box is labeled as Recreation Events.

          <p><br></p>
          <p>When students couldn't login from the login page, 12% of them decided
            to create a new account.  However, they didn't know that they already
            had an account because they are UCSD students so trying to create a
            new account won't work.  Trying to create a new account is a
            <b></u>knowledge-based mistake</u></b> because if they had seen that
            they needed to click on the blue box on the login page since they are
            UCSD students, then they wouldn't have trouble creating an account.

          <p>29% of interviewees typed "kayaking" in the search bar when trying to find
            the Moonlight Kayak event.  When they pressed enter to find a result,
            no results showed because the pages searching algorithm is very specific.
            This is an example of a <b><u>rule-based mistake</u></b> because the students
            had the correct intentions but typing in "kayaking" instead of "kayak" is
            incorrect when using this search bar.

          <p>One interviewee inserted the dashes between the numbers.  Formatting
            it this way was incorrect and was said to be an invalid phone number
            because you are just supposed to have numbers.  This is a
            <b><u>rule-based mistake</u></b> because the student had the correct
            end goal but didn't correctly input the phone number.  They had the right
            intentions and thought they knew how to correctly input their phone number
            but the way they did it wasn't the way it should have been done.

          <p>When an interviewee was typing their email, they accidentally put a
            comma instead of a period before "edu".  This is an <b><u>action-based slip</u></b>
            because they meant to put a period but ended up putting a comma.  The
            student had the correct plan but made the wrong action.

              failed to notice and click on the blue box that is meant for UCSD students.
              After having trouble logging in, this led to some students clicking on the

      <b>Organization and Understanding</b>
      <p>One potential tradeoff is between organization and understanding, in
        particular, the categorization of classes into categories and the user
        comprehension of the categorization.  Multiple interviewees attempted to
        use the left sidebar on the Programs page of the UCSD Recreation website,
        which includes organization by classification, semester, and category.  Under
        these branches are sub-branches that include "aquatics", "kayaking", and simply
        "sports."  Although these general terms likely follow universal definitions,
        confusion can still occur between the <b><u>conceptual</u></b> and
        <b><u>mental models</u></b>.  These categories were likely created in order
        to help the user rapidly navigate to a specific program.  However, this
        efficiency may not be achived if the user doesn't follow the creator's idea
        of the way the groups were created and may result in <b><u>errors</u></b>.</p>

      <img class="img-responsive" src="images/recpage/info-readability.png"></img>
      <p> 76% of our interviewees had a problem with the login screen.  The readability of the
        login screen presented a major problem: the login button for UCSD users blended
        too much with the page.  For redesign inspiration, we looked at the Google and Facebook login pages.
        Google seemed to aim for an easy-to-read, limited login screen
        whereas Facebook opted for a highly compled, hard-to-read login. We aimed for somewhere
        between the two.</p>
      <p>We separated the UCSD login from the non-UCSD login through a vertical
        divide as opposed to a horizontal, as people thought the UCSD login box was a header
        for the login.  The vertical split keeps the same information on the page while
        making it much more readable.
      </p>
      <img class="img-responsive" src="images/recpage/aesthetic-readability.png"></img>
      <p>Around half of our interviewees made an error on the recreation site's search
        page.  People would search "moonlight kayaking" and the results would only
        return articles or events that contained the exact string "moonlight kayaking" in it.</p>
      <p>After looking at the SDSU recreation site, we saw that it searched for different
        forms of the word ("kayak" will return results containing "kayak", "kayaks", "kayaking", etc.),
        but it lacked aesthetic and was hard to read.  We wanted to make a page that
        was easy to read, had good aesthetic, provided good feedback as to what the
        user searched, and had an algorithm that would return the most relevant results.</p>

          <p><br></p>
          <p>For the home page, our main redesign involves the menu bar.  We decided
            to discard the registration, classes, adventures, and schedule tabs.  We
            removed the "schedule" and "registration" tabs because our interview data
            suggested that they were unnecessary.  The "schedule" tab led to a page
            without any sort of schedule and only 1/17 interviewees clicked the tab
            in attempt to schedule the "moonlight kayak trip".  Similarly, the "registration"
            tab was never clicked by the interviewees, so we decided that it didn't
            need to be on the menu bar.  Our redesign also includes the replacement of
            the "classes" and "adventures" tabs with "indoor activities" and "outdoor activities".
            We made this decision based on the fact that many <b><u>knowledge-based mistakes</u></b>
            were made when our interviewees were looking for "kayaking" under the "classes"
            tab instead of "adventures".  The current categorization is confusing
            because it isn't common knowledge as to what UCSD recreation lists as a class
            versus an adventure.  By categorizing the activities by indoor and outdoor,
            we will be able to reduce error.  The categorization of indoor and outdoor
            is much easier to navigate because most activities are either traditionally
            done indoors or outdoors and is pretty universally accepted as so.  If
            the activity can be done both indoors and outdoors, we would have that activity
            listed under both tabs to avoid confusion.
