  <!--overview-->
  <div class="casestudy-container" style="background-color: #F8F8F8;">
    <p>Credible is an online marketplace for comparing personalized loan rates
      from multiple lenders, all in one place. Once a user selects the loan they
      want, they are sent to the lender's site to finalize the offer — marking the
      end point for many users' journies on Credible.</p><br>
    <center><img src="images/hub/how-it-works.png" width=100% style="max-width: 750px"></center>
    <!--<p class="caption" style="margin-bottom: 0px">How Credible works</p>-->
    <br><br>
    <h4>Problem</h4>
    <p>As part of the lifetime value (retention) team, one of our OKRs is to evolve
      Credible’s transactional relationship with customers to that of a long-term
      relationship. For this initiative, our marketers plan to increase the volume
      of emails they send to people after they get a loan. These emails will lead
      users back to Credible's hub (logged in experience), but the current hub
      is barebone & lacks direction and usefulness for progressing one's financial
      goals/needs. For this reason, I was tasked with improving the Credible hub.</p><br>
  </div>

  <!--identifying the problem-->
  <div class="casestudy-container">
    <h2 style="margin-top: 0px">Identifying the problem</h2>
    <p>I started this project by looking at the ui/ux of our current hub to identify
      pain points and areas for opportunity. This helped me gain a deeper understanding
      of the problem space and aid discussion of project goals with my PM.</p><br>
    <img src="images/hub/painpoints1.png" width="100%" style="margin-bottom: -10px">
    <p class="caption" style="margin-bottom: 64px"><i>Overview page for archived users</i></p>
    <img src="images/hub/painpoints2.png" width="100%" style="margin-bottom: -10px">
    <p class="caption" style="margin-bottom: 64px"><i>Overview page for active users</i></p>
    <img src="images/hub/painpoints3.png" width="100%" style="margin-bottom: -10px">
    <p class="caption"><i>Financial tools page</i></p>
  </div>

  <!--who's using the hub?-->
  <div class="casestudy-container" style="background-color: #F8F8F8;">
    <h4>Who is using the hub?</h4>
    <p>Next I worked with my PM & business intelligence to learn more about our
       hub users:</p>
    <ul style="font-size: 18px">
      <li>What have they already done on Credible? Have they started a loan request?</li>
      <li>How did they get to the hub? Where are they coming from?</li>
    </ul>
    <br><img src="images/hub/users.png" width="100%" style="margin-bottom: 24px">
    <p>Knowing their entry source helped me think through what the user's mindset
       is and what needs/wants they have as they enter the hub. For example, 31% of
       users with an active loan request are exiting their rates dashboard and
       entering the hub. This suggests that they're unsure about their rate
       options, which gives us the opportunity to a) provide info to make them
       more confident in their options and/or b) show them other options.</p>
  </div>

  <!--ideation & prioritization-->
  <div class="casestudy-container">
    <h2 style="margin-top: 0px">Ideation & Prioritization</h2>
    <p>I brainstormed opportunities & improvements based on customer goals,
       business objectives, and the pain points I identified.</p>
    <br><img src="images/hub/goals.png" width="100%" style="margin-bottom: 32px">
    <p>For our largest user group, the archived users, I wanted to focus on optimizing
      the loan request empty state (since it's the first thing they see) and
      providing guidance (e.g. suggesting a product, leading them to a calculator,
      etc.) Our next largest group of users are ones who currently have an active
      loan request. Since these users are already in the funnel with a request in progress, I
      wanted to focus on improving low hanging fruit in the hub to help them complete
      their loan request and close on a loan.</p>
  </div>

  <!--prioritizing features-->
  <div class="casestudy-container" style="background-color: #F8F8F8;">
    <h4>Prioritizing features</h4>
    <p>I worked with my PM to determine which ideas we wanted to
      test & then prioritized them based on what subset of users they help, how
      much they might impact conversion and engineering effort:</p>
    <br><img src="images/hub/priority.png" width="100%" style="margin-bottom: 32px">
    <!-- <ol style="font-size: 18px">
      <li><b>Overview & loan request empty state</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Improving the "Overview" page was highest priority since it's
          the default page when you sign in. As the first touchpoint, my goal for
          this page was to provide more guidance for the user so they're better
          able to discover products, financial tools, and other resources like
          blogs and calculators.</li>
        <li>The first section on "Overview" provides the user information on their
          loan request. Since the majority of our users are archived, I worked
          on optimizing the empty state for this section first.</li>
      </ul>
      <li><b>Loan request active state</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>My next priority was optimizing the loan request active state since
          our active users are the hub's second largest userbase. I wanted to
          focus these improvements on emphasizing the users' immediate next step,
          give more visibility to the "Best Rate Guarantee" value prop, and
          provide the most relevant info at each stage of the request to aid
          users in their decision.</p>
      </ul>
      <li><b>Navigation</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Navigation improvements were slated for last because they were scoped
          as the largest engineeering effort. I wanted to improve the information
          hierarchy & optimize the navigation for mobile, since the majority of
          hub users are mobile.</p>
      </ul>
    </ol> -->
  </div>


  <!--competitor research-->
  <div class="casestudy-container">
    <h4>Competitor Research</h4>
    <p>Before starting sketches, I looked at direct competitors, such as SoFi,
      and other companies, like Credit Karma and Nerdwallet, that are in the personal
      finance space but don't necessarily have a loans marketplace to get a sense of the landscape.</p>
    <br>
    <img src="images/hub/competitor-screenshot.png" width="100%"><br><br>
    <img src="images/hub/competitor.png" width="100%" style="margin-bottom: 32px">
    <p>My key takeaways were...</p>
    <ul style="font-size: 18px">
      <li><b>Page structure</b>: vertically stacked sections vs board with mix
        of different modules</li>
      <li><b>Content above the fold</b>:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Focus is on what users are monitoring (e.g. credit score, finances)</li>
          <li>“Let’s show all our different products”</li>
          <li>Product recommendations based on the user's profile</li>
          <li>Highlight blog articles</li>
        </ul>
      <li><b>Presenting other products</b>:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Show multiple products in one section</li>
          <li>Give one product its own section for greater emphasis</li>
          <li>Show specific offers (e.g. "Get a rate as low as 5%")</li>
        </ul>
      <li><b>Calculators</b>: placed strategically where the users could need them</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <!--design iterations-->
  <div class="casestudy-container" style="background-color: #F8F8F8;">
    <h2 style="margin-top: 0px">Design explorations</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 14px">(Note: Credible went through a rebrand during this
      project, which is why you'll see our "Crediberry" pink instead of the orange
      seen in earlier screenshots)</p><br>

    <!--empty-->
    <h4>Loan request empty state</h4>
    <p>The current empty state has plain text stating "No active loan requests"
      and "Get started today!", but doesn't include any actual CTA to <i>start</i>
      a request. My redesign goal for this section was to show the user what our
      different products are and give them paths to start a request for those products.
      For my explorations, I tried different visual treatments and CTA types—even
      considering embedding the first question of the form itself.</p>
    <img src="images/hub/iterations/empty.png" width="100%" style="margin-top: 48px; margin-bottom:48px">
    <p>My biggest takeaways from these explorations were:</p>
    <ul style="font-size: 18px">
      <li>Due to the amount of products Credible has, having primary and secondary
        CTAs for each product (see option two) make the section vertically long &
        overwhelming with the amount of buttons. So I iterated on using either the
        link or ">" approach for less visual clutter & removing the secondary
        "Learn More" CTA since a) we want more people to start the form and b)
        the start of the form provides education about the loan and the process</li>
      <li>Our simpler iconography (see options two and four) is less visually
        overwhelming and less distracting than our more detailed pictographs</li>
      <li>Displaying the first question of the form could help with getting more people
        in the funnel, but it gives less visbility to the other loan options.
        Plus our model for recommending products is in its starting phases, so I
        wouldn't want to strongly market one loan option over the rest</li>
    </ul>

    <!--submission tiles-->
    <h4 style="margin-top: 80px">Loan request active state</h4>
    <p>We have 5 types of loan requests and each one has a different process, so
      before jumping into designs I met with the PM and designer for each vertical
      to understand:</p>
    <ul style="font-size: 18px">
      <li>What the steps of the request process are</li>
      <li>What information is important for the user to know at each step</li>
      <li>What our intended goal is for the user at each step</li>
      <li>What pain points (if any) the user has at each step</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="images/hub/iterations/tiles-thinking.png" width="100%" style="margin-top: 32px;">
    <p class="caption" style="margin-bottom: 64px"><i>Brainstorm—What's important for the user at each stage of their loan request?</i></p>
    <p>Now that I had a better understanding of the different loan request
      processes, I was able to start designing! For my explorations, I tried different
      visual treatments for communicating to the user where they're at in the
      process, providing info from their dashboard to encourage them to continue on,
      clarity on what their next step is, and emphasizing the best rate guarantee
      value prop.</p>
    <img src="images/hub/iterations/tiles.png" width="100%" style="margin-top: 48px;">
    <img src="images/hub/iterations/tiles-2.png" width="100%" style="margin-top: 48px; margin-bottom: 48px">
    <p>Most of my iterations for this tile centered around how to show the user
      useful info from their rates dashboard. The challenges I faced were making
      this info easy to digest/understand, as well as meet legal requirements.
      For example, I initally listed out what the lowest APR and lowest monthly
      payment were (as these are two data points important to the user), but
      legal reviewed it and we weren't able to display the APR and monthly payment by
      themselves — they must be coupled together. So I pivoted the designs to show
      the option with the lowest APR and the option with the lowest monthly payment.</p>

    <!--financial tools-->
    <h4 style="margin-top: 80px">Financial tools</h4>
    <p>This section currently displays a simple banner with general value props about
      our financial tools. For my initial explorations (see options one and two),
      I iterated on this banner approach and focused my changes on better communicating
      the benefits of the financial tools and making the ui more eye-catching
      (e.g. using a colored background so it stands out the majority white tiles on the hub).</p>
    <img src="images/hub/iterations/tools.png" width="100%" style="margin-top: 24px; margin-bottom: 48px">
    <p>For my other explorations (see option four), I focused on highlighting the
      specific monitoring tools we offer (Debt Tracker & Credit Score), since users
      mentioned in interviews that they like to track this information. By emphasizing
      these tools, I hope to see more engagement with our financial tools.</p>

    <!--navigation-->
    <h4 style="margin-top: 80px">Navigation</h4>
    <p>I first thought about if we should keep the current left-side nav design
      or change it to a top nav design (similar to our logged out pages). I
      decided to keep the left-side nav because:</p>
    <ul style="font-size: 18px">
      <li>Vertical navigation allows for scalability. It will be easy to add new
        hub features to the vertical nav whereas we'd eventually run out of room
        with a horizontal one.</li>
      <li>It's easier for people to search through a vertical list than a horizontal one.</li>
      <li>Vertical navigation translates well to mobile</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="images/hub/iterations/navigation.png" width="100%" style="margin-top: 48px; margin-bottom: 64px">
    <p>My biggest takeaways from these explorations were:</p>
    <ul style="font-size: 18px">
      <li>"Home" should be grouped with the rest of the hub pages instead of sitting by itself</li>
      <li>The spacing between links can be improved to create visual balance and make the groupings more clear</li>
      <li>The active state is most noticeable with the light blue background</li>
      <li>Icons make the nav feel cluttered. Is there a way to make it feel more clean?</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

      <li>By highlighting our monitoring tools on the home page, I hypothesize we'll see
        increased activation of these tools leading to more repeat
        engagement on Credible</li>

    <p><b style="font-size: 20px">Desktop navigation</b>: I focused on establishing
      an information hiearchy that's easy to follow and makes the hub tools appear
      most important</p>
    <ul style="font-size: 18px">
      <li>Updated the active state ui (bold font + light blue background) so
        that it has better contrast from the inactive state</li>
      <li>Reduced the spacing and modified the typography so that the 2 groups
        of links ("My Credible Hub" vs "Compare Rates") are more clear</li>
      <li>Reordered the nav so that the hub tools are listed before the products
        since our priority for the user is to engage with the hub tools</li>
      <li>Added icons to the hub links to aid recognition and so they appear more
        prominent than the product links</li>
      <li>Consolidated the links to individual calculators with one link to the
        calculators page & now have links to individual financial tools since I want
        to prioritize engagement with the tools over the calculators</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b style="font-size: 20px">Mobile navigation</b>: Redesigned the tabs at
      the top of the page to be a bottom nav more similar to a native app</p>
    <ul style="font-size: 18px">
      <li>Renamed "Overview" to "Home" to be consistent with the naming
        established in the side nav</li>
      <li>Replaced "Archive" with "Calculators" since viewing archived loan requests
        aren't important while financial calculators are more useful resources</li>
      <li>Designed the active state ui to match the visual treatment done on desktop</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Learnings</h2>
    <p>The three phases of the hub redesign were each rolled out as a/b tests. So
      far we've seen success with the redesigned loan request empty state (with
      more people entering the funnel and starting a loan application) and the
      financial tools section (with more people activating these tools & coming
      back to Credible to see credit score/account updates).
    <p>On the flip side, we've seen a decrease in conversion with the redesigned
      loan request active state. One hypothesis is that due to poor market conditions,
      the "best options" we show aren't very good, so it deters people from wanting
      to see the other options. This suggests we might want to test showing other
      info (either from their dashboard or maybe educational tips) or even reverting
      back to showing no information from their dashboard.</p>
