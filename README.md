Hello World! I'm a coffee shop lover studying human computer interaction and computer science at UCSD. I believe successful experiences are made possible by being open to different perspectives rooted in observations and user centered mindsets! This summer you can find me in Seattle as a teaching assistant for the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program at F5.

In my free time, you'll find me trying out BuzzFeed's Tasty dessert recipes, hiking towards a beautiful view, or watching 'New Girl' on Netflix.
