      <p>We've all seen the tragic site of the enormous pile of dishes in the sink.
         And there's always that one roommate that you have to constantly remind to pay their rent.
         When these little issues add up, they become increasingly frustrating
         causing unneeded tension and anger between roommates. Wanting to eliminate
         these unnecessary frustrations, my team went to the source of it.
         These frustrations seem to be rooted in poor household management, which
         led us to the question <b style="text-decoration:underline; text-decoration-color: #6CC894">how do roommates
         organize and manage household tasks?</b></p>

      <div class="well well-sm">
        <p> After speaking with different college students about their housing situations,
            management styles, and roommate stories, we wrote up our <u>observations</u>
            and created a list of <u>user needs</u> based off our interviews.

         household.  This is harmful because it causes unnecessary stress and
         conflict between roommates.  This can be improved with better communication
         between roommates.</p>

      <p>Instead of diving right into a specific user interface design, my team
         used our <u>point of view</u> as inspiration for creating three different design ideas that each
         address a <u>user need</u>.  We illustrated these ideas with <u>storyboards</u>.</p>

            <p>Chores Tracker</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p><b>House Rules</b>: Different understandings of how to do a chore can lead
         to unnecessary arguments over wrongful completions of that chore.  the
         house rules storyboard centers around this need for a defined set of
         rules/steps, so that everyone is on the same page.  We liked this idea
         because it helps hold roommates more accountable for doing a chore correctly,
         and it simply helps define a list of house rules and steps for chores that
         can easily be accessed.</p>
      <p><b>Chores Reminder</b>: During our interviews, we found that some households
         use a tally chart to track how many times people have done chores, but don't
         assign specific chores to anyone.  Since chores aren't assigned, this allows
         a lot of freedom and flexibility, which can be good, but can also be bad because
         you're relying on the idea that people will complete their fair share and will
         do so consistently.  The dirty dishes storyboard includes a feature that helps
         assign specific chores to people and sends reminders, so that there is no
         confusion as to who is in charge of what and holds people accountable for doing
         their fair share.</p>
      <p><b>Chores Tracker</b>: The chore tracker storyboard was inspired by how
         house-related messages get lost or overlooked in the midst of other texts, Facebook
         messages, etc.  We want to emphasize these messages by confining house-related
         chats to one app, so people don't have to mix house issues with other messages.
         We like this idea because it allows roommates to read a continuous house-related
         feed instead of having to scroll back through texts.</p>

      <p>Next we took the ideas from our two best storyboards (no eggs + dirty dishes)
         to create our <u>paper prototypes</u>. In this stage of the design process, we
         focused on the higher level UX design as opposed to perfecting all the
         little details, which you can find below.

      <p>Our next decision was really hard for us as we loved both of our paper
         prototypes. After further discussing evaluations, user testing, and what
         we would need to change, we decided on <u>pursuing prototype one</u>.  We liked
         the visual qualities that prototype two offered, but we concluded that it
         wasn't as intuitive as prototype one and was way more complex. Our goal
         for our app was to give roommates an easy platform for household communication
         and prototype one provides all the necessary features while maintaining simplicity.
         Below is our <u>video prototype</u> that demonstrates how the app will be used.

      <p class="title">Wireframes</p>
      <p>Now that we had an idea of how our app will function, it was time to start
         thinking about how we will actually build it.  To start this process, we created
         low-fidelity <u>wireframes</u> of our "home" and "tasks" pages, as they are both
         major screens in our app.  These wireframes provide the layout of the
         screen and roughly what information it holds, so that we know
         what we need to code later on.

<div class="enter">
  <div class="container" id="userTesting">
    <div class="padding">
      <p class="title">User Testing</p>
      <p>After completing our wireframes, we began coding our working prototype
         (note that our main focus was to implement the described interactions,
         so it wasn't developed in a mobile format).
         Once our prototype was built, we went through user testing to learn what
         users were thinking while using our prototype and if their <u>mental models</u>
         matched ours. Ultimately we were looking for ways to improve our interface.</p>

      <p>Before we started user testing, we developed a <u>testing protocol</u> to
         minimize observer bias. We were particularly interested in the user flow
         of creating, assigning, and completing a task, as this was the main feature
         that would enhance roommate communication. Below are our findings and the changes
         we made based off our testing.
       </p>

       <img class="img-responsive" src="images/todolist.jpg"></img>
       <p><b>Empty To Do List</b>:
          In our original design, when users encountered the empty to do list, they
          either thought there was an error or the page was still loading.  However,
          this was the correct page because there simply weren't tasks to show in their to do list.
          To mitigate confusion we added informational text telling the user
          that there were no tasks in their to do list.
       </p>

       <p><b>Notifications Shortcut</b>:
          In our original design, the user only had access to the notifications when
          they were on the home page.  During user testing, only one person navigated
          to the notifications page, which includes various helpful assignment alerts
          and confirmation messages.  It was common for users who didn't go to the
          notifications to voice their wish for alerts and messages, such as the ones
          provided by our notifications. Seeing the need to drive more traffic to the
          notifications, we added the notification bell to every page, so users would
          always have access to it, which will hopefully lead more users to check their
          notifications.
       </p>

       <img class="img-responsive" src="images/tasks.jpg"></img>
       <p><b>Directions</b>:
          During testing, we found that it wasn't intuitive for users to click the
          checkboxes to assign a task, so we added directions in the new design that
          explicitly explain how to assign a task.  Note that the directions will only
          appear when there are new tasks to assign.
       </p>
       <p><b>Styled Checkbox</b>:
         Users had a hard time distinguishing that the checkboxes were clickable
         in the original design, so we styled and made the checkboxes significantly
         larger.  We hope that this styling makes it more intuitive to click the
         checkboxes.
       </p>
       <p><b>Notifications Badge</b>:
          In addition to making the notifications available on every page, we added
          a notifications badge for when the user has new alerts and messages.  This
          is a way to keep users informed as before they had no way of knowing how many
          new messages they had unless they went to the notifications badge.
       </p>

       <img class="img-responsive" src="images/inprogress.jpg"></img>
       <p><b>Completed vs History</b>:
          In our original design, we had a "Completed" tab that included a full
          list of completed tasks, so that users have access to a record of what
          each other have done to make sure everyone is doing their fair share.
          However, naming the tab "Completed" led to navigational issues as users
          thought this tab was where they could complete a task.  To mitigate this
          confusion, we changed the name of the tab to "History".
       </p>
       <p><b>To Do List Shortcut</b>:
          After assigning a task to themselves, the user is still in the "Tasks"
          page, so a lot of users navigated to the "in-progress" tab to complete
          a task as it is on the same page.  This was a common mistake during testing
          and confusing for users as you can only view a task on the "in-progress" tab.
          In our new design, we hope to improve navigation by creating a link to the
          to-do list, which is where you can complete a task.
       </p>
       <p><b>Color Coded List</b>:
          During testing, users noted how they would like some way to differentiate
          task assignments in the "in-progress" tab, so that it's easier to grasp
          the info.  In response, we color coded the "in-progress" list so that the
          current user's tasks are highlighted.
       </p>

      <p class="title">Final Design + Reflection</p>
      <p>After two rounds of user testing, we completed a working prototype for the
         Happy House web app, which you can <a class="line-link" href="https://lee-tammy.github.io/HappyHouse/login.html" target="_blank">test online here</a>.  Below is a demo video
         that shows the main features of our app.

      </div><p>Demo Video</p></div>

      <p>Overall, my team and I were really proud of the web app that we produced.
         It was extremely scary coming into this class and being told on the first day
         that we would need to produce a working prototype by week 10.  It seemed
         slightly impossible in the beginning as we didn't even have an idea for what
         our app should be.  However, I think everything worked out as my team and I
         found the inspiration for this app naturally as roommate conflicts is something
         that we've all had.
      </p>
      <p>It was amazing getting to know my team better each week and by the end I
         was glad to call them my friends.  Though we didn't always agree on every
         aspect of the project, we had such a high level of respect for each other
         making it easier to open up to each other's ideas.  All in all, it was a
         great experience to get to go through the entire design process from needfinding
         all the way to prototypes and user testing, and it will be an experience
         that I will use to guide me in my future design projects.
