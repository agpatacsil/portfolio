      <!--BACKGROUND-->
      <p class="header" style="margin-top: 40px">BACKGROUND</p>
      <p>Being active is a HUGE part of my life, so when I stopped rowing, I got
        a gym membership so I could (<i>attempt to</i>) keep up my fitness! My family was
        already part of LA Fitness, so it was easy for them to add me to their plan.<br><br>

        Once my membership was good to go, my dad had me download the LA Fitness App,
        which I would need for check-in since they don‚Äôt give physical membership cards.
        I got the app, set up my account, and was good to go! However every time I go to
        the gym I‚Äôm struck by how poorly the app is designed in regards to structure and
        aesthetic. The home page is extremely busy, the overall app is very text heavy,
        acessing the membership card is difficult, and finding information is very inconvenient!<br><br>

        And I‚Äôm not alone in this opinion.
      </p>
      <center><img src="images/LAFitness/Ratings.png" width=75% style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 30px;"></center>
      <p>The app has over 1.5K ratings and reviews in Apple‚Äôs App Store receiving
        an overwhelming amount of negative reviews and 1 star ratings. These
        responses showed a strong need for an improved mobile experience, so I
        decided to challenge myself and redesign this app!
      </p>



      <!--RESEARCH-->
      <p class="header">RESEARCH: MAJOR INSIGHTS</p>
      <p>I collected insight on how LA Fitness members use and regard the app by
        interviewing 3 gym members and reading 100+ of the most recent reviews
        in the App Store. Here's what I found:
      </p><br>

      <b>Too many steps required to access the digital membership card for front
         desk check-in</b>
      <blockquote>
        <p style="line-height: 1.2">
          <i style="font-size: 15px;">"I feel like the app should provide an
          option for the digital membership tag to be added to the Apple Wallet
          so you can double tap the button, scan and your on your way."</i><br><br>
          <i style="font-size: 15px;">"The only reason I use the app is to pull
          up my membership barcode."</i>

      </blockquote>

      <b>Check-in tracker hidden under My Account</b>
      <blockquote>
        <p style="line-height: 1.2">
          <i style="font-size: 15px;">"It takes too many clicks to get to your

        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <p style="line-height: 1.2">
          <i style="font-size: 15px;">"There are so many menus, subcategories
            that can all be merged and simplified."</i><br><br>
          <i style="font-size: 15px;">"The clunky buttons overcrowd the home screen."</i>
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <b>Accessing home club‚Äôs information (i.e. schedules, hours of operation)
        is inefficient</b>
      <blockquote>
        <p style="line-height: 1.2">

      <blockquote>
        <p style="line-height: 1.2">

        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <b>Outdated UI</b>
      <blockquote>
        <p style="line-height: 1.2">
          <i style="font-size: 15px;">"The app isn‚Äôt up to date with the new modern

          <i style="font-size: 15px;">"Congratulations! This looks like a hideous
            website from the 90s."</i>
        </p>
      </blockquote><br>

      <b style="font-size: 20px">üìçoverarching problem</b>
      <p>Users inefficiently navigate through the app due to the its current page structure and organization</p>



      <!--COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS-->
      <p class="header">COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</p>
      <p>I examined how other popular gyms structure their app home pages, especially
        where they place access to the digital membership card and noting what type
        of information they include on the home page. Here's what I found:</p><br>
       <img src="images/LAFitness/competitive-analysis-chart.png" width=100%><br><br><br>

       <p>All 4 apps place access to the membership card in one of the top corners,
         instead of having it out of site at the bottom of the screen as LA Fitness
         does. Additionally all these apps include a feature to log workouts,
         which LA Fitness currently doesn't offer, but should consider implementing.
         As for layout, Crunch Fitness and Gold's Gym are structured similarly to
         LA Fitness with the home page acting as the main menu, while Youfit and Planet
         Fitness have a bottom navigation bar. This allows more space for Youfit
         to include a calendar and advertisements and Planet Fitness to include
         a slider with weekly workout stats and advertisements. Lastly, Crunch Fitness
         has a cool feature called Crunch Live that allows users to watch live workout classes.</p>

      <!--SKETCHES-->
      <p class="header">SKETCHES</p>
      <p>Incorporating the insights from my research, I sketched 3 different
        home pages to start my ideation phase:</p><br>
      <img src="images/LAFitness/sketches.png" width=100%><br><br>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><b style="font-weight: 500">Sketch 1</b>‚ÄîThis design eliminates the extra step
            users currently take to get to their membership card by having it
            available on the home page. However some gym members still use their
            physical membership card for check-in and only use the app to look up
            gym information, so having the qr code as the home page's focal point
            wouldn't help these users.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b style="font-weight: 500">Sketch 2</b>‚ÄîThis design keeps the app's
            current layout of having rows of buttons, but changes the podcast
            advertisement to a block that includes easy access to the user's home
            club's information. Additionally, access to the membership card is
            moved to the top right corner.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b style="font-weight: 500">Sketch 3</b>‚ÄîThis is probably the
            simplest design of the three. It includes a personal greeting with an
            image of the physical membership key tag that users can click to pull
            up their digital one. Following are the list of available app features.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>After fully reviewing my sketches, I decided to pursue sketch 2 because
        I decided against including the membership card on the home page in
        case people use the physical one in favor for adding an option to add the
        membership card to the user's Apple Wallet. Additionally, I like how this
        design makes the home club's information easily accessible by providing
        shortcuts to its class schedule and details.</p>


       <p class="header">REDESIGN: HIGH FIDELITY SCREENS</p>
       <p>After sketching the remaining pages, I created high fidelity screens
         in Figma. You can click through the prototype
         <b><a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/rY68XZKwSGy0co5Mel37iv/LA-FITNESS?node-id=27%3A1&viewport=293%2C159%2C0.2355652004480362&scaling=scale-down" target="_blank">here</a></b></p>

             <i>Messages</i>, <i>Check-In History</i>, <i>Settings</i>, and
             <i>Contact Us</i> buttons minimized and added to the bottom of the
             header because they‚Äôre important features but secondary to the
             <i>Account Profile</i> and <i>Membership Card</i> features.</p>

           <p><b style="font-weight: 500">Home Club Info</b>‚ÄîHome club name, hours, and shortcuts to its

             streamline how frequently sought out information is accessed. New
             feature that tells users if the gym is currently busy or not busy,
             so they can factor that into their decisions.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
           <p><b style="font-weight: 500">Favorites</b>‚ÄîExpanded the <i>Favorites</i> button to improve
             its discoverability and provide shortcuts to your favorite clubs,

    <p class="header">CONCLUSION + NEXT STEPS</p>
    <p>Since completing this redesign, I've noticed that some iOS users have a
      different home page than mine including an additional feature for court
      reservations (note: I made sure I have the latest update!). I want to see
      how this new feature would factor into my redesign. Also, I would love to do usability
      testing to get insight on potential areas for improvement in my redesign!</p>
