      <h3>background</h3>
      <p>Being active is a HUGE part of my life, so when I stopped rowing, I got
        a gym membership so I could (attempt to) keep up my fitness! My family
        was already part of LA Fitness, so it was easy for them to add me to their plan.</p>

      <p style="padding-top: 10px">Once my membership was good to go, my dad had me download the LA Fitness
        App, which I would need for check-in since they don’t give physical
        membership cards. I got the app, set up my account, and was good to go!
        However every time I go to the gym I’m struck by how poorly the app is
        designed in regards to structure and aesthetic. The home page is extremely
        busy, the overall app is very text heavy, acessing the membership card is
        difficult, and finding information is very inconvenient!</p>

      <p style="padding-top: 10px">And I’m not alone in this opinion.</p>
      <p><img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./assets/images/lafitness/Ratings.png" style="max-width: 500px;"></p>
      <p style="padding-top: 10px">The app has over 1.5K ratings and reviews in
        Apple’s App Store receiving an overwhelming amount of negative reviews
        and 1 star ratings. These responses showed a strong need for an improved
        mobile experience, so I decided to challenge myself and redesign this app!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-container-spacer">
      <h3>research: major insights</h3>
      <p style="padding-bottom: 10px">I collected insight on how LA Fitness
        members use and regard the app by
        interviewing 3 gym members and reading 100+ of the most recent reviews
        in the App Store. Here's what I found:</p>

      <h4 style="color: black">Too many steps required to access the digital
        membership card for front desk check-in</h4>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"I feel like the app should provide an option for the digital
          membership tag to be added to the Apple Wallet so you can double tap
          the button, scan and your on your way."</p>
        <p>"The only reason I use the app is to pull up my membership barcode."</p>
      </blockquote>


      <h4 style="color: black">Check-in tracker hidden under My Account</h4>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"It takes too many clicks to get to your check-in history..."</p>
        <p>"Need the “Check In” view that tracks visits to work, for my employer
          to verify visits."</p>
      </blockquote>


      <h4 style="color: black">Home page is cluttered and overwhelming</h4>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"There are so many menus, subcategories that can all be merged and
          simplified."</p>
        <p>"The clunky buttons overcrowd the home screen."</p>
      </blockquote>


      <h4 style="color: black">Accessing home club’s information (i.e. schedules,
        hours of operation) is inefficient</h4>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"Getting to schedule for my club is tedious… Every time it insists on
          searching for all clubs “near” me, and making me choose which one I want
          to see a schedule for."</p>
        <p>"Can we add a function on the front homepage with the Hours of Operation
          for the users Home Club?"</p>
      </blockquote>


      <h4 style="color: black">Searching for classes is tedious</h4>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"I wish we could look at multiple class types at the same time."</p>
        <p>"Why can't I search a specific class type for a specific club?! Why
          is it only one or the other??!!!"</p>
      </blockquote>


      <h4 style="color: black">Outdated UI</h4>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"The app isn’t up to date with the new modern interfaces and just isn’t
          aesthetically pleasing."</p>
        <p>"Congratulations! This looks like a hideous website from the 90s."</p>
      </blockquote>
    </div>

    <div class="section-container-spacer">
      <h3>the problem</h3>
      <p>Users inefficiently navigate through the app due to the its current
        page structure and organization.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-container-spacer">
      <h3>competitive analysis</h3>
      <p>I examined how other popular gyms structure their app home pages,
        especially where they place access to the digital membership card and
        noting what type of information they include on the home page. Here's
        what I found:</p>
      <p><img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./assets/images/lafitness/competitive-analysis-chart.png" style="padding-top: 5px"></p><br>
      <p>All 4 apps place access to the membership card in one of the top corners,
        instead of having it out of site at the bottom of the screen as LA Fitness
        does. Additionally all these apps include a feature to log workouts, which
        LA Fitness currently doesn't offer, but should consider implementing. As
        for layout, Crunch Fitness and Gold's Gym are structured similarly to LA
        Fitness with the home page acting as the main menu, while Youfit and Planet
        Fitness have a bottom navigation bar. This allows more space for Youfit to
        include a calendar and advertisements and Planet Fitness to include a slider
        with weekly workout stats and advertisements. Lastly, Crunch Fitness has
        a cool feature called Crunch Live that allows users to watch live workout
        classes.</p><br>
      <p><img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./assets/images/lafitness/competitive-analysis.png"></p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-container-spacer">
      <h3>sketches</h3>
      <p>Incorporating the insights from my research, I sketched 3 different home
        pages to start my ideation phase:</p>
      <p style="padding-top: 10px"><img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./assets/images/lafitness/sketches.png"></p><br>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Sketch 1</b>—This design eliminates the extra step users currently
          take to get to their membership card by having it available on the home
          page. However some gym members still use their physical membership card
          for check-in and only use the app to look up gym information, so having
          the qr code as the home page's focal point wouldn't help these users.</li>
        <li><b>Sketch 2</b>—This design keeps the app's current layout of having
          rows of buttons, but changes the podcast advertisement to a block that
          includes easy access to the user's home club's information. Additionally,
          access to the membership card is moved to the top right corner.</li>
        <li><b>Sketch 3</b>—This is probably the simplest design of the three. It
          includes a personal greeting with an image of the physical membership
          key tag that users can click to pull up their digital one. Following
          are the list of available app features.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>After fully reviewing my sketches, I decided
        to pursue sketch 2 because I decided against including the membership card
        on the home page in case people use the physical one in favor for adding
        an option to add the membership card to the user's Apple Wallet. Additionally,
        I like how this design makes the home club's information easily accessible
        by providing shortcuts to its class schedule and details.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-container-spacer">
      <h3>the redesign</h3>
      <p>After sketching the remaining pages, I created high fidelity screens in
        Figma. <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/rY68XZKwSGy0co5Mel37iv/LA-FITNESS?node-id=27%3A1&viewport=293%2C159%2C0.2355652004480362&scaling=scale-down" target="_blank"><u>Click through the prototype</u></a></p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-container-spacer">
      <h3>01 home page</h3>
      <p><b>Problem</b>—Disorganized and cluttered. Doesn’t empower users to
        efficiently navigate the app.</p>
      <b>Redesign</b>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Header</b>—<i>Account Profile</i> and <i>Membership Card</i> buttons placed in
          the upper corners of the header for better discoverability. <i>Messages,
          Check-In History, Settings,</i> and <i>Contact Us</i> buttons minimized and added
          to the bottom of the header because they’re important features but
          secondary to the <i>Account Profile</i> and <i>Membership Card</i> features.</li>
        <li><b>Home Club Info</b>—Home club name, hours, and shortcuts to its class
          schedules, details, and trainers added to the home page to streamline
          how frequently sought out information is accessed. New feature that
          tells users if the gym is currently busy or not busy, so they can factor
          that into their decisions.</li>
        <li><b>Favorites</b>—Expanded the <i>Favorites</i> button to improve its discoverability
          and provide shortcuts to your favorite clubs, classes, and instructors.</li>
        <li><b>Additional Buttons</b>—Button icons enlarged, colored, and centered
          to improve aesthetics.</li>
        <li><b>Slider</b>—Promotional items moved below the buttons and placed
          in a slider so LA Fitness can promote multiple things (i.e. podcasts, blogs).</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="padding-top: 10px"><img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./assets/images/lafitness/home-redesign.png"></p><br>
    </div>

    <div class="section-container-spacer">
      <h3>02 membership card</h3>
      <p><b>Problem</b>—Too many steps to manually pull up the membership card.
        QR code is difficult to scan. Using location services to automatically
        pull up your membership card when close to LA Fitness drains your phone battery.</p>
      <p><b>Redesign</b>—Give users option to add membership card to Apple Wallet to streamline process. Enlarge QR code to improve how it scans.</p>

      <p><b>Redesign</b>—Placed a <i>Check-In History</i> button on the home page's header for easier accessibility.</p>

      <p><b>Redesign</b>—Allow users to trigger multiple filters (e.g. location,
        class type, time) at once to optimize how one finds classes. Improve

      <p>Since completing this redesign, I've noticed that some iOS users have a
        different home page than mine including an additional feature for court
        reservations (note: I made sure I have the latest update!). I want to see
        how this new feature would factor into my redesign. Also, I would love to
        do usability testing to get insight on potential areas for improvement
        in my redesign!</p>
